    <p>Find the following in our 2005 newsletters:</p><p>-Maximo's 80th Birthday Party (Dec)<br />-Pupusas in Minnesota (Nov)<br />-News from the Coffee Farm (Oct, Aug, July)<br />-Iced Coffee recipe (Aug)<br />-Photos from Velasquez family and farm (Dec/Feb/April)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>December 2005</strong><br />We hope you had a lovely Thanksgiving. Guillermo really enjoyed his trip home to Honduras for his father's 80th birthday. Thankfully, for those of us left behind, his cousin did a great job filming the whole thing. It was great fun to watch the wild breaking of the pinata (made to look just like Don Maximo), the many speeches given in honor of Don Max by family members from near and far, to hear the marimba band that played late into the night and watch some crazy dancing. It almost felt like being there.</p><p>Here is photo of the grandchildren presenting Maximo with a shirt and tie to wear to the party.</p> <p><img title="Maximo's Birthday Present" src="files/vfamily/u4/Maximo_s_Birthday_present.jpg" alt="Maximo's Birthday Present" width="300" height="225" align="left" /></p><p>Here is another shot of Maximo and Natalia surrounded by their children and grandchildren at the big event. We are grateful for the full life they have lived.</p> <p><img title="Maximo's Birthday Party" src="files/vfamily/u4/Maximo_s_Birthday_party.jpg" alt="Maximo's Birthday Party" width="300" height="225" align="left" /></p> <p><em>Flavored Coffee</em><br />We were pleased with the great response to our request for flavorvotes. It was still really hard to choose, but we finally decided on Cocoa Mocha Twist and Eggnog for our two special holiday flavors, in addition to the regulars - Dutch Chocolate, African Cinnamon, Almond Amaretto, French Vanilla, Irish Cream, and Carribean Hazelnut. See the product page for <a href="file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/user/My%20Documents/Coffee/VFC%20Website/orders.html#flavored">descriptions</a> of all these wonderful flavors available in our smaller 8 oz bags whole bean or ground for only $5.50.</p> <p>We wish you a blessed holiday season and joy and laughter in the new year. We are grateful for your coffee purchases!</p> <p><strong>November 2005</strong><br /> Sunday night Guillermo brought home a nice Honduran treat for supper                -- <em>pupusas</em>. You might say they are like a filled tortilla.                Cheese or <em>chorizo</em> (spicy sausage) is placed between flavored                tortilla dough (<em>masa</em>) and grilled. It is typically served                with a cabbage salad and a spicy red sauce. We're excited to have                found an excellent source for this favorite Central American dish                in West St. Paul on Concord Street. A small Salvadoran vendor has                set up outside Panaderia Don Pancho in one of those portable food                vehicles (you know, like you might see at the State Fair). The pupusas                are made fresh while you wait. Hmm, yum.</p> <p>Guillermo will be filling up on more Honduran food next week when                he leaves for a quick solo trip to Honduras to celebrate his father's                80th birthday. Don Maximo surprises everyone with his age, as he                looks and acts much younger than he is. (Click <a href="file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/user/My%20Documents/Coffee/VFC%20Website/family.html">here</a> for pictures of Don Maximo). We wish our whole family could go,                but we're glad Guillermo will have a chance to join in the extended                family celebration. Hopefully the rest of us will get to go in January                or February when Cathy's parents plan to make their first trip to                Honduras.</p> <p>Before Guillermo leaves, we'll be filling our November coffee orders.                To make sure we have enough coffee on hand for your holiday gifts,                please get your December orders in before December 1 if possible.</p> <p><em>Flavored Coffee</em><br /> For the Holidays, you might also try one of our flavored coffees                in the smaller 8 oz bags. Currently, we offer Almond Amaretto, Cinnamon,                Chocolate, French Vanilla, Hazelnut, or Irish Cream. We'd like to                add one or two special flavors for December and we'd like your opinion.                Check out the amazing <a href="http://www.europeanroasterie.com/Default.asp?Page=105">list</a> of possible flavors our roaster offers. Everyone who submits their                flavor opinion before December 1 gets their first bag on us.</p> <p><strong>October 2005</strong><br /> While the temperatures here are starting to dip toward Autumn (well                at least they were until this last heat spell), the Velasquez coffee                farm is seeing quite a bit of rain. Guillermo talked to his dad,                Maximo, last night when he was in the city for a few days (there's                no phone or electricity for that matter on the farm).</p> <p>Maximo said it has been raining so much that there was a small                mud slide from the dirt road that runs past the farm house to an                area below the house where there is an old chicken coop. Because                of the heavy rain that is typical in the cloud forest, the family                has been careful, especially in the past 15 years, to preserve the                original old growth forest on their farms and to plant new trees                when possible. Because they have seen the effects of erosion due                to clear cutting and slash and burn farming, Guillermo's brothers                Abilio and Sabel and his brother-in-law Alonzo have been strong                advocates for shade grown coffee on their farms and in their communities.</p> <p>Rain or shine, we're happy to be deliverying and mailing this shade                grown coffee to you.</p><p>By the way, we learned that one of our coffee                customers, Natasha Fleischman was recently featured in an article                in Minnesota Monthly because she is a survivor of sudden cardiac                death. It is an inspiring story and a good reminder to stay healthy                and enjoy life so we decided to share the <a href="http://www.minnesotamonthly.com/sponsoredSection/goRed/survivorCardiacArrest.html">link</a> in our monthly email.</p> <p><strong>September 2005</strong><br /> We hope you had a lovely Labor Day weekend. We did what many Minnesotans                did and attended the State Fair one day and spent time with family.                We used the rest of the time to work around the house and get ready                for school to start tomorrow. Our boys are excited to be returning                to Adams Spanish Immersion Elementary in St. Paul. We feel so fortunate                to be part of such an excellent public school and are pleased to                be able to offer our coffee as a school fundraiser. (Let us know                if you are interested in learning more about selling Velasquez Family                Coffee for a <a href="file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/user/My%20Documents/Coffee/VFC%20Website/fund.html">fundraiser</a> for your school,                church or other group.)</p> <p>You might be interested to know that in Honduras the school year                starts in February and ends in November. Because coffee is such                an important agricultural crop in Honduras, their school year was originally                scheduled to have children out of school to help with the coffee                harvest during December and January, much like our school year is                still based on a traditional agriculture calendar.</p> <p><strong><a name="IcedCoffee"></a>August 2005</strong><br /> We hope you are enjoying summer. We've been trying to deal with                the heat by taking the kids to the beach as much as possible and                hanging out in the many lovely public libraries near our home. With                September (and school) just around the corner, we are determined                to make the most of each and every remaining day of August.</p> <p>But we're also keeping up with a steady stream of coffee orders.</p><p>We're pleased to have added Fresh Earth CSA Farm to our list of                distributors. Check out this great organic community supported farm                at <a href="http://www.freshearthfarms.com/" target="_blank">www.FreshEarthFarms.com</a>.</p> <p><em>News from the Farm:</em> On the coffee farm things are pretty                quiet. Guillermo's Mom was pleased to have recently gotten a turkey                hen to go with her turkey rooster and as a result to find a number                of turkey eggs. We haven't heard if they've hatched yet!</p> <p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Iced Coffee</strong></span>:</em> With the heat, you might want to try this iced                coffee recipe from <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/" target="_blank">www.recipezaar.com</a>.</p> <p>You'll need 6 cups strong coffee and one 14-oz can sweetened condensed                milk for 6-8 servings.</p> <p>1. Combine brewed coffee and sweetened condensed milk in a large                pitcher.<br /> 2. Refrigerate until chilled.<br /> 3. Serve over ice. (Tip -- use leftover coffee to make coffee ice                cubes with. Then you have the chill without getting watered down.)<br /> 4. Relax and enjoy!</p> <p><strong>July 2005</strong><br /> We hope you are having a lovely 4th of July weekend. Like many of                you, we have enjoyed fireworks, a picnic at the park and extra time                to work around the house. Next weekend we'll be busy too, delivering                and mailing coffee.</p> <p>This month, we are pleased to have what we hope is the first of                many regular updates from Guillermo's brother Abilio in Honduras.                The update is possible thanks to email and the help of Brian Young,                a Peace Corp volunteer living and working in the Rio Negro community                where Guillermo's parents and his brothers farm. Here's what Brian                wrote this month:</p> <p><em>"The news from Rio Negro has mostly revolved around the                many rains that we have been receiving. The refreshing and much                welcomed rain storms are aiding what looks to be a good future harvest                for this coming year. In between the storms Abilio and the family                has been cutting down weeds and esentially cleaning the farm for                the next harvest.</em></p> <p><em>In the Rio Negro school...A teacher, Bertilia´s co-worker,                quit a few months ago. Bertilia (Abilio's wife) had her hands full                as she took on the responsibility of teaching all 90 students in                the school. After many frustrating months, a teacher has now accepted                and began teaching with Bertilia. The recent addition of the new                teacher has been a great relief to Bertilia and students.</em></p> <p><em>At the moment, we are constructing another beautiful cabin on                Abilio´s farm where hopes continue to thrive on a future in                eco-tourism for the community. Others in the community are also                taking advantage of the off-season to construct cabins and work                on unique crafts.</em></p> <p><em>The family and the people of Rio Negro want to welcome all of                you that would like to visit the farm first hand. You can even come                in November or December and pick your own coffee beans! We greatly                appreciate your support and encouragement. Your support goes a long                way to further help our community remain sustainable."</em></p> <p>---Familia Velasquez y Amigos de Rio Negro Comayagua, Honduras,                C.A.</p> <p><strong>June 2005</strong><br /> Well, summer is definitely here, with heat, humidity, thunderstorms                and even a few mosquitos. Even so, we are enjoying our back yard                and garden as much as we can.</p> <p>We've had lots of great feedback about our newly redesigned Website.                Next month, we hope to have some news from a Peace Corp volunteer                who is living and working on the coffee farm in Rio Negro. Our next                shipment of fresh coffee from Honduras should be arriving in Minnesota                by then too (we hope!!) Enjoy these long summer days!!</p> <p><strong>May 2005</strong><br /> We enjoyed speaking with many of our regular customers and many                new folks at the 4th annual Living Green Expo here in Saint Paul                two weekends ago. It is very affirming to get so much positive feedback                (and we sold a fair amount of coffee too!)</p> <p>We are very excited to announce the launch of our new and much                improved Website. Same address -- www.vfamilycoffee.com -- but many                more photos, and additional information about our coffee, our monthly                delivery service, and our family in Honduras. We welcome your comments                and suggestions. Many thanks go to Tara Burns for her lovely design!                (She also gets the credit for designing our logo and our label.)</p> <p>We were also excited to hear from our family that the next shipment                of over 10,000 pounds of "green" coffee should be leaving                Honduras this week -- by far our biggest shipment yet.</p> <p><strong>April 2005</strong><br /> From March 16 to April 6, 2005 our whole family made our what has                become an annual visit to Honduras. It was a wonderful time and                we'd like to share some of our experience with you through this                <a href="file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/user/My%20Documents/Coffee/VFC%20Website/slideshow/index.htm" target="_blank">slide show</a>.</p> <p><strong>March 2005</strong><br /> We are, of course, very much looking forward to our trip to Honduras.                It will be great to see all of Guillermo's family and to spend a                relaxing time up in the tropical mountains on the coffee farm. We'll                be there over Holy Week and Easter (a first for Cathy and the kids).                The coffee harvest is done now, but we'll have a chance to see the                coffee that they'll be sending to us and finalize arrangements for                shipping with Guillermo's cousin. If all goes as planned, your coffee                will be sent on a large barge from San Pedro Sula, Honduras to Miami,                where a trucking company will pick up to deliver to our roaster                in LeCenter, Minnesota. (We'll probably also bring a few smaller                sacks back with us on the airplane just to hold us over until the                larger shipment arrives.)</p> <p>As always, thank you for your coffee purchases! We just ran some                figures for our income taxes and we estimate that we sent nearly                $17,000 to Honduras in 2004 -- that is money that helped our family                and then was reinvested by them back in the Honduran economy. Thank                you for helping us make that happen!</p> <p><strong>February 2005</strong><br /> In Honduras, the coffee harvest is pretty much done. We are in communication                with our family members about preparing this latest coffee harvest                for shipment to us hopefully by April or May.</p> <p>We've also just purchased plane tickets for our annual trip to                visit family and the coffee farm. We'll be leaving on March 16 (just                after our March 12th delivery) and getting back April 6 (just before                our April 9th delivery). There shouldn't be any interuption in our                regular coffee deliveries, but we will be unavailable during those                three weeks. We're looking forward to being up in the mountains                and will come back full of photos and stories to share.</p> <p>In the meantime, here is one of Abilio picking coffee sent to us                via email by Brian Young, a Peace Corp volunteer living with Abilio.</p><p><img title="Abilio picking coffee" src="files/vfamily/u4/Avilio_picking_coffee.jpg" alt="Abilio picking coffee" width="225" height="300" align="left" /></p>  </div>
