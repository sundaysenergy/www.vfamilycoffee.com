    <p>-Cold Coffee for Hot Summer Days<br />-Maps and Photos from the Coffee Farm<br />-Open Your Home</p><p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Cold Coffee for Hot Summer  Days<br /></strong></span>The month of July has gone by in a hot and humid blur. We hope you have been  finding ways to stay cool!&nbsp;Because of the heat,&nbsp;we've been drinking ice coffee a  bit more than usual and thus thought&nbsp;it would be timely to&nbsp;share what we've  learned about cold press coffee recently as well as a fun recipe for homemade Kahlua.</p><p><span style="color: #000000;">Being lazy,&nbsp;ice coffee&nbsp;for us  usually just means poring what's left of our morning pot of drip-brewed coffee  over ice cubes and adding cream (and sometimes brown sugar or maple syrup).&nbsp;But  when&nbsp;a friend asked about low-acid coffee&nbsp;recently, we did some research into  cold-brewing coffee which we'd heard produces a less acidic cup of coffee. Turns  out there is some <a href="http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/5728227/ns/today-food/t/my-coffee-cold/#.TjrSYWHjZkw" target="_blank">evidence</a> that cold brewing coffee reduces both acid and caffeine compared with regular  coffee and at least according to some has a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/27/dining/27coff.html" target="_blank">superior taste</a>.  It is also quite simple and doesn't require any special equipment. </span></p> <p>COLD BREW -- One simple&nbsp;recipe from <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2008/08/cold-brewed-iced-coffee/" target="_blank">Smitten  Kitchen</a> suggests mixing&nbsp;1/3 cup ground coffee&nbsp;with 1 1/2 cups water  in a glass jar. Cover and let sit at room temperature 12 hours. Strain with a  coffee filter. Mix equal parts coffee concentrate with water (hot or cold) or to  taste. (Add cream or sugar as desired.) We're guessing that some&nbsp;of you have  more experience with cold-brew coffee than we do. We'd love to hear what you've  discovered.</p> <p>KAHLUA -- Here is another coffee recipe that we've enjoyed lately -- homemade  Kahlua!<br />In 2 cups hot brewed coffee  dissolve&nbsp;1 1/4 cup white or brown sugar. After it cools add 2 cups vodka or rum  and 1/2 tsp vanilla. Pour into glass bottles and store in a cool, dark place for  2 weeks. Improves with age. Serve cold with cream over ice!</p> <p>Feel free to send us&nbsp;any other cold coffee recipes you might have. We'll post  them with other <a href="http://www.vfamilycoffee.com/links">coffee recipes</a> on our website.</p> <p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Maps and Photos from the Coffee  Farm<br /></strong></span><span style="color: #000000;">Gabe Sidman, who grew up in Wayzata,  MN, spent two years as a Peace Corp volunteer living in Rio Negro near our  family's coffee farm. He's been back in the States since last fall, but missed  everyone so much he took a quick trip back in July. Before he left, he emailed  us several maps he has created of the Rio Negro community. We've uploaded two of the maps to the <a href="../visit.html#MAPS" target="_self">Visit the Farm section</a> of our website. After he returned, he  emailed us several photos as well. Here is a link to a short <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/velaeber/sets/72157627232863657/detail/" target="_blank">slide-show</a> including photos of all the new baby coffee plants being grown as a result of high coffee prices, the cabin Guillermo was working on in February and a lovely photo of Maximo and Natalia where they are happiest -- working on the coffee farm.<br /></span></p> <p>A few weeks later, a group of 10 people from Most Holy Trinity Church in St. Louis Park, MN also visited the farm for a quick stay in the midst of a mission trip to a Honduran orphanage. Jane Flannigan one of the leaders of the group was kind enough to send us the following update of their trip:</p><p><em>"We had a fabulous time at the farm! All went well for our         group of 10.&nbsp;I haven't been there since summer 2008 and I was         surprised to see all the electrical appliances! A refrigerator,         TVs, stereos, outdoor lights. Wow! We hiked down to the        hydraulic  pump with Avilio and took a dip under the waterfalls.        It was  really hot that day. Very impressive set up for the        electricity.  Avilio's knowledge of the land and coffee business        was also  impressive for our group. The next day, those who went        on the  strenuous hike up to the big waterfalls loved the hike. A        few of  them commented that they could have easily spent an        entire week  at the farm.... On the way down the mountain one of        the older  ladies said the farm visit was the highlight of her        trip. Not the  first time I've ever heard that comment! I'm        looking forward to  the next visit. It would be nice if we could        stay a little bit  longer."</em></p><p>By the way, we are still planning on bringing&nbsp;two group to the farm in  January and June 2012. Stay tuned for more details as they develop.</p> <p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Open Your Home</span></strong><br />Recently we've  learned of two different opportunities to open your own home to visitors that may be of  interest.</p> <p>--Highland Park Junior High Spanish Immersion program in St. Paul is looking  for a host family for a young intern from Columbia. Let us know if you'd like  more details for this rich cultural experience and we'll send them to you.</p> <p>--<a href="http://www.midwestanimalrescue.org/" target="_blank">Midwest Animal Rescue</a> is&nbsp;in urgent need of <a href="http://www.midwestanimalrescue.org/animals/detail?AnimalID=3617177" target="_blank">foster  families</a> for their rescue dogs. We've fostered a couple of dogs this summer  and have found it to be quite fun.</p> <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Still Time to give us Your  Feedback<br /></strong></span><span style="color: #000000;">About 20 people took time to  provide us with helpful feedback last month.&nbsp;If you haven't had a chance yet,  the quick 8-question survey is still available.
