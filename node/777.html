    <p>-Immigration Reform Action Alert</p><p>There is a chance of passing an important piece of     immigration reform legislation during the lame duck session. I'm     writing with a request for you to make a few phone calls THIS WEEK     (Today if possible) and to forward this link to people you know who     would also respond -- especially those in other states and in key     legislative districts here in MN (see details below).<br /> <br /> I am motivated to make these calls and send out this email because     the word is that opponents of this legislation typically out-call     supporters 100 to 1 in spite of the fact that polls show <a href="http://www.firstfocus.net/library/polling-and-opinion-research/public-support-for-the-dream-act">70%        of Americans favor this reform</a>. <br /> <br /> Here is the scoop ---- A vote on the DREAM Act may take place in     Congress this week or next – the week of November 29 or December 6th!&nbsp; The DREAM Act would     make a huge difference in the lives of undocumented youth who were     brought to the US by their parents and now, because they lack legal     status, face obstacles to their future. By removing such barriers,     the DREAM Act will allow immigrant students to pursue their dreams     through college education or military services. (For more details     see the following links:)<br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.twincities.com/ci_16721972?source=most_emailed&amp;nclick_check=1">Ruben        Rosario: Children of illegal immigrants deserve chance to live       their dream</a><br /> <a href="http://immigrationpolicy.org/just-facts/dream-act-2010">Immigration        Policy Center</a><br /> <br /> So --- here is what to do....<br /> <br /> <strong><em>Call the Capitol Hill switchboard at 202-225-3121</em></strong>,     and ask for your Senators and Representative, and <strong><em>urge         them to vote for and publicly support the DREAM Act</em></strong>.     Tell them, "I support the DREAM Act. &nbsp;This is a nonpartisan bill     that does the right thing for undocumented students and will     strengthen America." &nbsp;&nbsp; (<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">S 729 in the Senate         or HR 1751 in the House.)</span></span></p><p>See <a href="http://www.dreamactivist.org/">http://www.dreamactivist.org/</a> for a list of Senators and Representatives who are specifically     being targeted.</p><p>A few details about the Minnesota delegation:<br /> <br /> 1) SENATE -- Both MN Senators Klobuchar and Franken are cosponsors     of the DREAM Act. Call them to say "Thank You." Our calls     'strengthen their resolve.' They are also members of the Judiciary     Committee where they can push to bring the bill up for consideration     and a vote. Especially encourage their efforts to persuade their     Republican colleagues. We probably need <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-30/reid-s-push-on-immigration-bill-finds-little-republican-support.html">6       Republicans</a>&nbsp;in the Senate for the DREAM Act to happen.&nbsp; Please     forward this alert to any of your friends and family who live in     other states to contact their Senators as well. <br /> <br /> <br /> 2) HOUSE<br /> <br /> Tim Walz, 1st Congressional District - needs encouragement, there is     concern per his vote<br /> John Kline, 2nd Congressional District – not a likely supporter, but     try…<br /> TARGET - Erik Paulsen, 3rd Congressional District, Republican,     supports TPS Liberians; opposed<br /> DREAM in Minnesota legislature; business conservative who appears     non-ideological<br /> Betty McCollum, 4th Congressional District – will probably vote for<br /> Keith Ellison, 3rd Congressional District, only MN house member who     is a co-sponsor<br /> Michele Bachmann, 6th Congressional District – not likely to be a     supporter, but try…<br /> Collin Peterson, 7th Congressional District, needs encouragement,     there is concern per his vote<br /> James Oberstar, 8th Congressional District, needs encouragement but     a likely supporter<br /> <br /> <br /> For more details see following document put together by Church World Service. <br /> <br /> Thanks!!<br /> Cathy Velasquez Eberhart<br /> <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:cathy@vfamilycoffee.com">cathy@vfamilycoffee.com</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>--------------</p><p>DREAM ACT – ITS TIME HAS COME! (two pages, revised 11-24-10)<br />“This is our last opportunity to pass the DREAM Act for the next two years. Due to the anti-immigrant leadership<br />coming into the House Judiciary Committee, it will be nearly impossible to enact the DREAM Act or anything<br />positive for the immigrant community after this opportunity. It is more important than ever for our voices to be heard<br />loud, clear and strong that our Senators and Representatives MUST vote YES to the DREAM Act. “ - Jen Smyers,<br />Associate Director, Immigration &amp; Refugee Policy, Church World Service<br /><br />TAKE ACTION! DREAM Act Call-In<br />Call 866-945-0566. You will hear a brief message, then will be connected to the Capitol switchboard operator<br />(direct number to switchboard is: 202-224-3121). Ask to be transferred to your Senators and Representative. You<br />will be transferred to the receptionist for each office.<br /><br />Urge your Senators and Representative to vote for the DREAM Act so that undocumented high school graduates<br />brought to the United States as children can realize their potential through higher education and service to the<br />United States. This will benefit all Americans.<br /><br />WE ARE URGING PEOPLE TO CALL NOT ONCE, BUT MANY TIMES. Do all you can to create a climate of<br />YES for the DREAMers!<br /><br />BILL NUMBERS: In the Senate - S. 729. In the House of Representatives - H.R. 1751<br /><br />MINNESOTA CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION<br />(all can be called through the capitol switchboard - : 202-224-3121)<br /><br />Senate: Senator Klobuchar and Senator Franken are cosponsors of DREAM (there are currently a total of 40 cosponsors<br />in the Senate). Our calls can 'strengthen their resolve.' It is important to ask them to reach out to their<br />Republican colleagues. We probably need 6 Senate Republicans for the DREAM Act to pass in the Senate. It is<br />important to THANK our Senators for their support.<br /><br />House: At this time there are 134 House co-sponsors. Calls to all are needed - use the above telephone number.<br />Tim Walz, 1st Congressional District - needs encouragement, there is concern per his vote<br />John Kline, 2nd Congressional District – not a likely supporter, but try…<br />TARGET - Erik Paulsen, 3rd Congressional District, Republican, supports TPS Liberians; opposed<br />DREAM in Minnesota legislature; business conservative who appears non-ideological<br />Betty McCollum, 4th Congressional District – will probably vote for<br />Keith Ellison, 3rd Congressional District, only MN house member who is a co-sponsor<br />Michele Bachmann, 6th Congressional District – not likely to be a supporter, but try…<br />Collin Peterson, 7th Congressional District, needs encouragement, there is concern per his vote<br />James Oberstar, 8th Congressional District, needs encouragement but a likely supporter<br /><br /><br />DREAM ACT BACKGROUND<br /><br />DREAM MEANS – “Development Relief Education Alien Minors”<br /><br />THE DREAM ACT IS GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY AND SECURITY<br />Research has shown that providing a legal status for young people who have a proven record of success in the United<br />States would be a boon to the economy and the U.S. workforce. The U.S. military also needs the DREAM Act.<br />Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Military Personnel Policy, Bill Carr, stated that the law would be "good for<br />readiness" and would help to recruit "cream of the crop" students. The DREAM Act is part of the Department of<br />Defense's 2010-2012 Strategic Plan to assist the military in its recruiting efforts. (From Immigration Policy Center).<br /><br />THE DREAM ACT IS NOT AN AMNESTY<br />If they maintain good moral character and earn a high school diploma, after 6 years of conditional permanent<br />residency, they could apply for lawful permanent residency (LPR). As stipulated in current law, persons who<br />maintain LPR status for five years can apply for U.S. citizenship.<br /><br />WHAT THE DREAM ACT WILL DO<br />If passed, the DREAM Act will create a pathway to lawful permanent residence and eventual earned citizenship for<br />thousands of upstanding high school graduates who were brought to the United States as children years ago. These<br />young people have grown up in our communities and include honor roll students, star athletes, talented artists, and<br />aspiring teachers, doctors, and entrepreneurs.<br /><br />WHAT THE DREAM ACT WILL FIX<br />There is currently no way for undocumented children to pursue legal status in the United States. The DREAM Act<br />would allow undocumented children who entered the United States when 16 years or younger and who have lived in<br />the United States for five years to apply for conditional permanent residency.<br /><br />WHO THE DREAM ACT WILL HELP<br />Each year, approximately 65,000 capable high school graduates are prevented from attending college due to their<br />undocumented immigration status. Many of these children have lived in the United States since childhood mastering<br />English and dreaming of contributing to the future of America. In many cases they do not remember their parent’s<br />home country and consider the United States their home; they are culturally American. Through no fault of their<br />own, they are undocumented and cannot attend most colleges or find any legal employment.<br /><br />READ MORE? Check out this article -<br />http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2010/11/amnesty_and_decency<br /><br />The second to last paragraph of this article: “The DREAM Act sends the message that although American immigration<br />law in effect tries to make water run uphill, we are not monsters. It says that we will not hobble the prospects of young<br />people raised and schooled in America just because we were so perverse to demand that their parents wait in a line before<br />a door that never opens. It signals that we were once a nation of immigrants, and even if we have become too fearful and<br />small to properly honour that noble legacy, America in some small way remains a land of opportunity.”</p><p>-----</p><p>Rev.John Guttermann, <br /> Church World Service,<br /> MN Field Director,<br /> Comprehensive Immigration Reform<br /> 122 W.
