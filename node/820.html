  <div class="content">
    <p>-Apocalypse Now<br />-Finding Hope in a Time of Crisis<br />-Connecting Locally</p><p>Attending a movie last week, we noted that all the previews were for  dystopian movies -- stories where the planet or the human race is threatened  with annihilation and a few&nbsp;brave heroes are charged with saving the day. On TV  (and in books) it isn't much better -- what with zombies on "The Walking Dead,"  or the militia taking over a darkened planet on "Revolution," etc.&nbsp;What's behind  all this doom and gloom and might we dare to imagine a more positive future for  our planet? Since Earth Day is coming up in a few weeks, we thought we'd use our  April Coffee newsletter to explore these&nbsp;questions a bit.</p> <p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Apocalypse Now<br /></strong></span><span style="color: #000000;">So, what's with the apocalypse showing up everywhere these days? </span><span style="color: #000000;">Maybe it's&nbsp;just a hangover from the 2012 Mayan  calendar thing. But then again, maybe you saw the movie <a href="http://www.chasingice.com/" target="_blank">Chasing Ice</a>&nbsp;about disappearing polar ice?  Or perhaps you listen to MPR's <a href="http://minnesota.publicradio.org/collections/special/columns/updraft/archive/climate-cast/" target="_blank">Climate  Cast</a> each Thursday morning where they give the "the latest research on our  changing climate and the consequences we're seeing here in Minnesota and  worldwide." Maybe you read the Rolling Stones Article by Bill McKibbon, "<a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/global-warmings-terrifying-new-math-20120719" target="_blank">Global  Warming's Terrifying New Math-Three simple numbers that add up to global  catastrophe</a>." Or perhaps heard that scientists are blaming this <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/mar/25/frozen-spring-arctic-sea-ice-loss" target="_blank">colder  spring</a> on arctic ice melt. </span>Coming back from Honduras last month, we  were&nbsp;discouraged ourselves, having heard first hand about violent societal  disintegration&nbsp;in many communities there&nbsp;and witnessing the destruction of  forests and coffee plantations due to coffee rust. Many believe <a href="http://www.coffeekrave.com/crisis-in-the-fields-climate-change-and-coffee-rust/" target="_blank">climate  change</a> is one of the causes of coffee rust&nbsp;and scientists working with  climate change models are even predicting the <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0047981" target="_blank">extinction  of indigenous Arabica coffee</a>.</p> <p>Truth be told, based on the climate science that is out there, we will be  very lucky if the worst thing that happens due to climate change is the  extinction of coffee. If you aren't convinced that the future is grim, read "<a href="http://www.nationofchange.org/stand-still-apocalypse-1354008355" target="_blank">Stand  Still for the Apocalypse</a>" in which Chris Hedges reports on&nbsp;a&nbsp;Climate Impact  report written for the World Bank. (Really -- if you aren't worried about  Climate Change you should be. Stop and read his article now!) With scientists  saying we have about <a href="http://www.postcarbon.org/blog-post/1558152-victory-at-hand-for-the-climate" target="_blank">20  years</a> to turn this around and viewing little change at the upper levels of  government and society, is it any wonder we find ourselves "escaping"&nbsp;into  dystopian entertainment?</p> <p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Finding Hope in a Time of  Crisis<br /></span></strong>We spent Spring Break in the Chicago area where  Cathy's brother is teaching a class at Garrett-Evangelical Theological&nbsp;Seminary  called "Ethics of Hope in a Time of Crisis"&nbsp;and as usual our conversations were  rich and transformative. From a book on his class reading list, Jurgen Moltmann  writes, "<em>We become active in so far as we hope. We hope in so far as we can  see into the sphere of future possibilities. We undertake what we think is  possible." </em>So perhaps, we need to turn away from the zombies and look for a  more positive vision of what could be possible. Here are a few places you might  find that vision.</p> <p>-<a href="http://www.postcarbon.org/blog-post/1558152-victory-at-hand-for-the-climate" target="_blank">Victory  at Hand for the Climate Movement</a> by Paul Gilding - a recent blog post on the  Post Carbon Institute website that highlights the urgency and growing  possibility of removing oil, coal and gas industries from the economy. <br />-<a href="http://www.orionmagazine.org/index.php/articles/article/6681/" target="_blank">America the  Possible</a> by James Gustave Speth - His award winning <a href="http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300180763" target="_blank">book</a> and somewhat shorter <a href="http://www.orionmagazine.org/index.php/articles/article/6681/" target="_blank">essays</a> in Orion Magazine, give a vision of political, social and economic life in a  renewed America.<br />-<a href="http://www.transitionnetwork.org/" target="_blank">Transition  Network.org</a>&nbsp;- a growing global network that supports community-led responses  to climate change.<br />-<a href="http://www.resilience.org/" target="_blank">Resilience.org</a>&nbsp;-  an information clearinghouse and network started by the Post Carbon Institute to  build a world of resilient communities.&nbsp;<br />-<a href="http://neweconomicsinstitute.org/" target="_blank">The New Economics Institute</a>&nbsp;-  working to build a new economy that prioritizes the well-being of people and the  planet.</p> <p><span style="color: #800000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Actually, once you start  looking,&nbsp;you'll find&nbsp;an abundance of transformations happening all over the  planet. People near and far are transforming our <a href="http://www.resilience.org/guides" target="_blank">food, energy, and money  systems</a>&nbsp;making them more resilient, more sustainable, more local. But since  this is so urgent, the question to ask yourself becomes, "What can I do,&nbsp;here  and now." </span></span><span style="color: #800000;"><span style="color: #000000;">We all need to  get to work&nbsp;locally and we need to add our voices to the growing global  grassroots movement to transition our planet. (Check out <a href="http://350.org/" target="_blank">350.org</a> and the <a href="http://www.citizensclimatelobby.org/" target="_blank">Citizens Climate Lobby</a>&nbsp;to take  action today). </span></span></p> <p><span style="color: #800000;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a href="http://www.postcarbon.org/blog-post/1558152-victory-at-hand-for-the-climate" target="_blank">Paul  Gilding</a> in his article "Victory at Hand for the Climate Movement" writes,  <em>"</em></span></span><span style="color: #800000;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>this is no  longer about the future, itâs about now. We donât have 20 years to decide to  act; we have 20 years to complete the task. If we follow the science, then in 20  years we must have removed the coal, oil and gas industries from the economy and  replaced them.&nbsp; Itâs simple, itâs urgent and perhaps most importantly, itâs now  achievable."</em></span></span>&nbsp;</p> <p>May that be the glimmer of hope&nbsp;we need to take action&nbsp;just in time.</p> <p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Connecting Locally<br /></strong></span><span style="color: #000000;">Here in Minnesota, there are lots of fun ways&nbsp;a&nbsp;new economy is  emerging. Here a a few&nbsp;we're pleased&nbsp;to be connected with. </span></p> <p><span style="color: #000000;">-<a href="http://www.sweetscienceicecream.com/" target="_blank">Sweet  Science Ice Cream</a> is a small business recently started in our neighborhood  in St. Paul by Ashlee Olds who crafts her fabulous ice cream with natural,  organic and local ingredients.
