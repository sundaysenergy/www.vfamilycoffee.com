  <div class="content">
    <p>-So Much Bad News<br />-Life Goes On<br />-Honduras Travel Plans?</p><p>A while back, there was a commentary on Public Radio expressing frustration  that the media only covers bad news out of Africa. After an especially bad news  month for Honduras, we know how they feel. We are torn between grief at tragic  images from&nbsp;a country that&nbsp;seems to be&nbsp;falling apart and a feeling of  defensiveness that this isn't the whole story about this beautiful country. Read  our reflections below.</p><p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">So Much Bad News<br /></span></strong>Where to  begin? First there was the&nbsp;two-part Public Radio series on Honduras that  highlighted <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/02/11/146668852/in-honduras-police-accused-of-corruption-killings" target="_blank">police  corruption</a>, and a <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/02/12/146758628/who-rules-in-honduras-a-coups-lasting-impact" target="_blank">legacy  of violence</a>&nbsp;in the country. The series was in response to United Nations  statistics showing Honduras had the highest murder rate in the world in 2011 and  news that the Peace Corp, which has long had a big presence in the country, was  pulling all their volunteers. (See an article&nbsp;from <a href="http://www.hondurasweekly.com/peace-corps-volunteers-reflect-on-leaving-honduras-201202104844/" target="_blank">Honduras  Weekly</a>&nbsp;that quotes Minnesota native Gabe Sidman who spent two years as a  volunteer in our family's community of Rio Negro).</p> <p>Days later the world was horrified by scenes from the tragic fire at the  prison in Comayagua. (Yes, this is the city where Guillermo's sisters and  brother live. We drive by the prison on the way to their homes whenever we  visit). And then if this wasn't enough suffering, a few days later, the huge <a href="http://www.hondurasweekly.com/comayag%C3%BCela-fire-damage-pegged-at-us%247.9-million-201202194868/" target="_blank">market  place</a> in the Tegucigalpa colonia of Comayaguela (not&nbsp;to be confused  with&nbsp;Comayagua) burned to the ground, eliminating the livelihoods of nearly  20,000 people.</p> <p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Life Goes On<br /></span></strong>In the days that  follow, news here in the north has gone mostly&nbsp;silent on Honduras as tragedies  elsewhere take the stage. In Honduras, grief and outrage continue along with  clean up and rebuilding. We don't have answers for the tough questions of who is  to blame and what needs to be done to make it better. We just know that in the  midst of it all, Guillermo's oldest sister continues to go to work every day as  a dentist&nbsp;serving a&nbsp;small rural community, his other sister continues her job  teaching economics at the University of Comayagua, the coffee harvest is still  being brought in, and our family just celebrated the birth of the newest  great-grandchild --&nbsp;there are seven&nbsp;now, all of them boys. In other words, life  goes on.</p> <p>And not just for our family. We were reminded of the editorial about bad news  in Honduras that we linked to a few months back ("<a href="http://hondurasweekly.com/feed-the-better-wolf-201110314384/" target="_blank">Feed the  Better Wolf</a>"). It's worth re-reading. And from there found links to <a href="http://www.projecthonduras.com/" target="_blank">Project Honduras</a> whose "aim is to  present and exchange information on current and proposed grassroots projects to  empower the people of Honduras." The conference <a href="http://www.projecthonduras.com/conference/program-conference2011.pdf" target="_blank">program</a> gives a long list of positive efforts, including a fun toy company called <a href="http://www.tegu.com/index.php" target="_blank">Tegu</a> working out of the capital city  whose mission and magnetic blocks are so fun we just had to share it.</p> <p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Honduras Travel Plans??<br /></span></strong>In  light of the latest news, we are giving careful thought to our plans to bring a  group to the coffee farm in June of 2012. We still think there are wonderful  things to see and experience there. At this point in time, the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1135.html" target="_blank">State  Department</a> has NOT given any advisory warnings against travel in Honduras  other than&nbsp;information about <a href="http://www.travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1135.html#crime" target="_blank">crime</a>&nbsp;in  the country. Life on the coffee farm and where our family lives in Comayagua  continues to be quiet. We personally feel comfortable traveling with our  family.&nbsp;So, if there are people who want to travel with us to experience the  rainforest and the coffee farm, we are still willing to take them.</p> <p>Lynne Menturweck, who traveled with us in January of this year, ably  described this opportunity to connect to places and people beyond the  superficiality of the news. She kindly agreed to let us share her assessment of  the experience:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"This was a wondrous trip that I know I would never have been  able to experience on my own. I so appreciated your translating. My lack of  language skills was my biggest frustration. Everything else was a grand  adventure. I loved being outside, the family, the sense of being so far from  cities and so close to the sky and water and mountains. I'm not sure what else  to say. I was happy. The wonderful thing about travel is how it brings into  focus the rest of the world and reminds me how related we are to even the most  far away places. How the water on the mountain is so important to protect, and  how it's the same water in our rivers and the clouds. And how the faces in the  news reports are the faces of the people in the stores, and the streets, and the  homes we visit. That is what I take away from trips and this was a trip that's  indelibly burned into me."</em></p> <p>Let us know&nbsp;if you are interested in having the same "grand adventure."  Please contact us at <a href="mailto:coffee@vfamilycoffee.com">coffee@vfamilycoffee.com</a> for more  details on dates and costs so we can schedule an informational meeting in the  coming month. To proceed with planning, we will need a minimum of 5 confirmed  travelers before April 15.</p>  </div>
