  <div class="content">
    <p>-Peak Coffee<br />-New Coffee Prices<br />-Biological Diversity Photos</p><p>We had a great time talking with new and old coffee customers at the <a href="http://www.livinggreenexpo.mn/" target="_blank">Living Green Expo</a> last month. We also     received several nice responses to our May email <a href="http://www.vfamilycoffee.com/node/787" target="_self">newsletter</a> on sustainability,     including several customers who have tried No Impact Man's 3-week mini <a href="http://noimpactproject.org/experiment/" target="_blank">No Impact Experiment</a> and a     few&nbsp;suggestions for our own sustainability dilemas of coffee bags and   transportation. Keep those suggestions coming. This month, we continue the   environmental theme with recent news reports about "Peak Coffee" and photos of     wildlife diversity in the mountains near our family coffee farm.</p><p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Peak Coffee<br /></strong></span><span style="color: #000000;">Cathy's mom was the first to alert us to the concept of "Peak   Coffee" which she heard on NPR's <a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2011/04/25/am-coffee-prices-on-their-way-up/" target="_blank">Market     Place</a>. We've been aware that coffee prices have reached record   highs&nbsp;due to poor production in Colombia and and other key coffee producing     countries. Experts are now worried that poor coffee harvests are related to   climate change and that we may have reached "peak coffee" production levels for     the finicky arabica coffee trees that aren't responding well to the unusually     heavy rainfall and unusual temperatures coffee producing regions have been   experiencing the past few years.</span></p> <p>Environmentalists place the blame for higher coffee   prices&nbsp;squarely&nbsp;on&nbsp;Climate Change. (See <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/files/2011/03/peak-coffee-incoming-climate-change-killing-buzz.php" target="_blank">"Peak     Coffee Incoming: Climate Change is Killing Our Buzz."</a>) Others acknowledge     the weather's impact, but put blame for recent price hikes on commodity   speculation and the growing demand for coffee. (See <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/international-news/latin-american/peak-coffee-a-cup-of-trouble/article2038050/" target="_blank">"Peak     Coffee: A cup of trouble"</a>).</p> <p><span style="color: #800000;"><span style="color: #000000;">We wish we could say our experience     is different, but our family members have had smaller coffee&nbsp;harvests the     past few years too. They have&nbsp;seen&nbsp;colder, wetter winters and heavier     rains.&nbsp;(Guillermo's brother Avilio described a recent rain storm, like a     huge bucket of water being emptied over the farm for about 30 minutes&nbsp;--     this from someone who is used to heavy rain, having&nbsp;lived in the rain   forest his whole life!) They have noticed coffee trees blooming at unusual times     and an increase in coffee blight like .... On the positive side for coffee   farmers -- at least those with a decent harvest -- coffee prices are now at   record highs. </span></span></p> <p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>New Coffee Prices<br /></strong></span><span style="color: #000000;">The impact of all this on Velasquez Family coffee? Well for the     moment, rest assured, we have plenty of coffee. We are expecting our 2011 coffee     shipment in the coming month and at least at this point the 2012 harvest for   our   family looks promising -- it doesn't look like we have reached our "peak."   However, with market prices now reaching close to $3.00 a pound for green   coffee, we didn't feel comfortable continuing to pay our family a mere $2.20   a   pound as we have been doing for the past few years. (Remember that before we     started this business, they were only getting about $.50 pound. And the fair     trade minimum was only around $1.40.) </span></p> <p><span style="color: #000000;">For 2011, we have agreed to pay our family members $3.20     a pound as well as cover more of the exporting and importing costs. </span>As   a   result, we unfortunately need to increase our prices to our customers here.   Starting July 1, look for the following new retail prices (<em>fundraiser and     reseller customers, look for an additional email with your new prices coming   a   bit&nbsp;later</em>).</p> <p>12 oz bags of coffee&nbsp;- $9.00<br />8 oz flavored bags of coffee -   $6.50<br />5 lb bulk bags of coffee - $50.00</p> <p>While we regret having to change prices at all, we are glad that this is only     the 2nd time in our 10 year history that we have had to increase prices and that     we are able to keep our increase to around 6-7% (compared to the <a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2011/04/25/am-coffee-prices-on-their-way-up/" target="_blank">12%     and 20% increases</a> being reported by Starbucks and Maxwell House.) Please   let   us know if you have any questions or concerns about this change&nbsp;(and feel     free to stock up on extra coffee before prices go up July 1, if you   wish).</p><p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p><p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Biological Diversity on the Coffee   Farm<br /></strong></span><span style="color: #000000;">Instead of ending this   email&nbsp;with the negative&nbsp;news of higher prices, we are happy to have     beautiful photos to share. We recently received an email from Josiah Townsen,   a   biologist who has spent a great deal of time in Honduras and on our family's     coffee farm in the Comayagua National Mountains. He was kind enough to let us     share a link to his <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/josiah_townsend/sets/72157624997956438/" target="_blank">photo     album</a> full of beautiful mountain shots and diverse wildlife, and even a few     of Guillermo's brother Avilio and his mini-hydroelectric generator.   Enjoy!</span></span></p>  </div>
