    <p>-MN 2020 Article<br />-Coffee Q&amp;A</p><p>We hope the start of 2013 is going well for you! After several busy weeks      filling all of our many December coffee orders (our biggest month yet!), we had      a relaxing holiday break with family and friends. Now with the kids back at    school, we turn our thoughts back to coffee matters.&nbsp;Thankfully our January      newsletter has practically written itself! We were fortunate to be featured in      an article by Lee Egerstrom of Minnesota 2020 entitled, "<a href="http://mandrillapp.com/track/click.php?u=14833503&amp;id=63ef57f4bd114f31a04fdb3435d4491f&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mn2020.org%2Fissues-that-matter%2Feconomic-development%2Fminnesotas-influence-on-the-coffee-trade&amp;url_id=c756106a4dc7c906c1cc415b829d0777cacba6dc&amp;tags=_all,_sendcoffee@vfamilycoffee.com" target="_blank">Minnesota's Influence on the Coffee Trade</a>." We also share a      coffee Q&amp;A&nbsp;exchange we had with <a href="http://mandrillapp.com/track/click.php?u=14833503&amp;id=63ef57f4bd114f31a04fdb3435d4491f&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wholefarmcoop.com%2F&amp;url_id=8f2b3f1bd3064d2285a114b845fc328f31a0ce73&amp;tags=_all,_sendcoffee@vfamilycoffee.com" target="_blank">Whole Farm Coop's</a> Tim King.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">MN 2020 Article<br /></span></strong>When we sent      out a promotional postcard to a few St. Paul neighborhoods in December, a copy      found its way to the hands of Lee Egerstrom a veteran journalist and Economic      Development Fellow with <a href="http://mandrillapp.com/track/click.php?u=14833503&amp;id=63ef57f4bd114f31a04fdb3435d4491f&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mn2020.org%2F&amp;url_id=6ae308d0607f6a00a334904b78b77853500eb4fa&amp;tags=_all,_sendcoffee@vfamilycoffee.com" target="_blank">Minnesota 2020</a>.   He    gave us a call and the result was a very nice article that has circulated    through the local internet media including the <a href="http://mandrillapp.com/track/click.php?u=14833503&amp;id=63ef57f4bd114f31a04fdb3435d4491f&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcdailyplanet.net%2Fnews%2F2012%2F12%2F12%2Fminnesotas-influence-coffee-trade&amp;url_id=1a4fa7c50aa5113ff712ebbf676de7f4c29565cb&amp;tags=_all,_sendcoffee@vfamilycoffee.com" target="_blank">Twin      Cities Daily Planet</a>. Egerstrom writes:</p> <blockquote style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr"><p><em>"There is a strong 'buy local' angle to premium coffees imported,      roasted, distributed and brewed in Minnesota. Several local companies are      actually offering coffee with a conscience as they are among the most socially        responsible coffee purveyors in the world. One of the most unique local coffee        companies is Velasquez Family Coffee, based in St. Paul, which combines the        concept of community-supported agriculture (CSAs) with socially responsible        importing practices gaining strength within our local coffee economy. It is        like a CSA because the coffee beans come from several members of the Velasquez        family near Comayagua, Honduras, said Cathy Velasquez who works full-time on        the family business</em>....<a href="http://mandrillapp.com/track/click.php?u=14833503&amp;id=63ef57f4bd114f31a04fdb3435d4491f&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mn2020.org%2Fissues-that-matter%2Feconomic-development%2Fminnesotas-influence-on-the-coffee-trade&amp;url_id=c756106a4dc7c906c1cc415b829d0777cacba6dc&amp;tags=_all,_sendcoffee@vfamilycoffee.com" target="_blank">Read        more</a>."</p></blockquote> <p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Coffee Q &amp; A<br /></span></strong>We were also      pleased to participate in an&nbsp;email&nbsp;Question and Answer exchange    initiated by Tim King for <a href="http://mandrillapp.com/track/click.php?u=14833503&amp;id=63ef57f4bd114f31a04fdb3435d4491f&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wholefarmcoop.com%2F&amp;url_id=8f2b3f1bd3064d2285a114b845fc328f31a0ce73&amp;tags=_all,_sendcoffee@vfamilycoffee.com" target="_blank">Whole Farm      Coop</a> (our first and largest wholesale partner -- and our    own&nbsp;household's favorite source of locally grown groceries).    While&nbsp;some version of the&nbsp;Q &amp; A will be circulated in the coming      months&nbsp;by Whole Farm Coop, we thought you would enjoy an advance    preview.</p> <p><em>Q. Weâve all heard about shade grown coffee. Can you tell us what that      means exactly?<br /></em>A. Shade grown coffee maintains the natural forest canopy      of old growth forest. Coffee plants are transplanted below and between larger      trees. We've written a lot more about this on our <a href="../shade-grown" target="_self">website</a> and have a few    pictures of what it looks like on our farm.</p> <p><em>Q. Iâve seen coffee like that in Mexico. It looks like a forest but I      think its more like a garden. Is that true? <br /></em>A. I think it is equal    parts forest and garden. The forest growth is carefully controlled and trimmed,      weeds are managed by machete, organic fertilizer is applied. But at the same      time, the wild plant and animal life of the forest continues all around the    coffee and there are parts at the edges and in the steepest areas that just keep      being completely wild. Tropical rainforest grows so quickly that even a small      time without human contact and it has taken over again.</p> <p><em>Q. How often do you have to plant new coffee trees. How do you care for      the other trees that grow with the coffee?<br /></em>A. Coffee trees can produce      well for about 5 years and then they are cut back significantly and spend 2-3      years regrowing before they produce again. In any given year, about 1/4 of the      coffee is cut back or regrowing to maintain good production. New varieties of      coffee plants are started and planted from time to time. These past few years      because coffee prices were so high, a lot of new coffee was planted in open    spaces. Coffee Rust ("el rolla") has become a problem throughout Honduras and      Central America, but our family coffee farms thus far seem to be mostly spared      because they are using several varieties of coffee that are more resistant.    Occasionally, Guillermo's brothers have planted new hard wood trees throughout      their property to help bring back more of the old traditional forest. Shade from      the trees is controlled by trimming branches from time to time.</p> <p><em>Q. When is the harvest season in your part of Honduras?<br /></em>A. On   the    farm where Guillermo grew up and his parents still live, the coffee harvest    begins in November and ends in February. One of his brothers and a    brother-in-law have land on another side of the mountain that goes as late as      March or April.</p> <p><em>Q. Your family hand picks the coffee. I think it is hard to understand      that if you have just seen a roasted coffee bean. What does your family pick?      How does that work? Can the harvesters pick from the same tree more than once      during a season?<br /></em>A. The coffee plant produces white flowers in the    spring and summer that turn to green berries and then ripen to a beautiful red      between November and March depending on the location. To make sure only the ripe      coffee is picked, it needs to be picked by hand several times during the harvest      season, often 3 or 4 times, and the coffee picker tries to only pick the red      berries. Often this harvest time coincides with the rainy season and the coffee      grows on steep mountains, so the job often requires walking on steep muddy paths      below dripping forest trees. The red coffee berries are first put in a small      basket tied around the waist and then compiled in large sacks that are carried      on one's back up the hill. A few pictures about the picking process can be found      on our <a href="../hand-picked" target="_self">website</a>.</p> <p><em>Q. What happens to a coffee cherry before you can dry it?<br /></em>A. The      red coffee cherries are brought to the farm house to the "beneficio" -- the area      where the coffee is processed. The cherries are pored into a machine that    separates the pulp from the 2 hard coffee seeds inside. (On our farm the coffee      pulp is collected and composted and there are trenches dug in the area to    prevent all of the sugars from the pulp from washing into the rivers). The    coffee seeds are covered with water and soak for about 24 hours in a large    cement container. This soaking time allows the sugars in the coffee to ferment      slightly which makes sure the coffee is flavorful. After this soaking time the      coffee is rinsed and then spread out to dry.</p> <p><em>Q. Can you describe how your family dries its coffee? Are there other      ways to dry coffee?<br /></em>A. In the past, all of our family's coffee was dried      on cement patios. When the coffee was sold on the open market, it didn't matter      if the coffee was completely dried. It could still be sold with some moisture   in    it. But now that they are selling most of their coffee to us, it needs to be      completely dry for storage so it doesn't get moldy. Because coffee harvest time      is also the rainy season, this creates a logistical problem. Sometimes coffee      can be brought into the valley where it is drier and spread on patios there.      Some of our family members are also experimenting with green houses and drying      serandas. More about all of this also on our <a href="../sun-dried" target="_self">website</a>. Right before the    coffee is ready to ship, the coffee is hulled at a local mill (there is one more      layer of a dry covering that needs to be removed). It is sorted to remove small      or damaged beans, and then packaged in 150 lb burlap sacks.</p> <p><em>Q. How does your family get its beans to Minnesota?<br /></em>A. Once a      year, we work with a couple of other parties (including Farmer to Farmer in    Wisconsin) that have coffee in that region to fill a container that is    transported by ship from Puerto Cortez, Honduras to a port in the US. The    container then goes by train to Minnesota and our coffee is unloaded in LeCenter      Minnesota where our roaster, European Roasterie, stores our coffee on pallets   in    their warehouse. We send them roasting orders each month according to our needs      for that month so our coffee is always freshly roasted.</p> <p>Photos of the whole process from coffee seedling to sacks of coffee at our      roaster can be seen in our coffee photo <a title="VFC Photo slide-show" href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.396397147113782.96949.322870731133091&amp;type=1&amp;l=82c02cee29" target="_blank">slide-show</a> on Facebook (and while you are there, make sure to "Like" us).</p> <p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Holiday Flavors Still    Available<br /></span></strong>We sold&nbsp;LOTS of our holiday flavors in    November and December and just about ran out of a few things (Whew! It was    close!). We've reordered a little bit more for January, but&nbsp;once they're      gone, that's it.&nbsp;Once again, the 2012 holiday flavors are: <em>Wind    Chill</em>, <em>Gingerbread Spice</em>, <em>Drunken Uncle</em> and <em>Almond      Toffee</em>. All four of these flavors are available in&nbsp;8 oz packages,    whole bean and ground and in limited quantities of decaf for $6.50. Visit our      website for&nbsp;descriptions and details. Our <a href="803" target="_self">regular flavors</a> continue to      be&nbsp;available during this time as well.</p>  </div>
