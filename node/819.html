    <p>-To Honduras and Back Again<br />-"La Roya" - A National Emergency</p><p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">To Honduras and Back Again</span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="color: #800000;"></span></strong>In an attempt to hold onto a little bit of the sweetness of our recent trip  to Honduras, I've changed the photo on my computer desktop to a view of our  little cabin on the&nbsp;coffee farm where I spent my mornings reading on the front  porch. Guillermo would get up early and go up to his parents house for coffee  and conversation and then kindly sent our daughter and niece&nbsp;back to the cabin  with a cup for me. The cows would come by to visit. The view of the mountain was  amazing. All in all, it was delightful. You can see this&nbsp;picture and&nbsp;a few more  in&nbsp;a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.424793174274179.1073741825.322870731133091&amp;type=1&amp;l=ca2639209f" target="_blank">slideshow</a>&nbsp;of  our trip on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/VelasquezFamilyCoffee" target="_blank">Facebook&nbsp;page</a>.&nbsp;You can  also read highlights&nbsp;from our trip&nbsp;in the newsletter that follows.&nbsp;</p><p><img style="float: left;" src="../sites/www.vfamilycoffee.com/files/u4/IMG_6476adjsm.jpg" alt="Our Cabin on the Farm" width="235" height="175" />In  spite of all the bad news about violence and instability in Honduras, we found  our family and the places they live to be largely&nbsp;uneffected. The&nbsp;3 hour  drive&nbsp;from San Pedro ("the murder capital of the world") was uneventful  (pleasant even, with a stop for&nbsp;freshly picked pineapple at a roadside stand, and  another stop at the Lago de Yahoa to soak up some sun near the beautiful  mountain lake).&nbsp;We spent the first day and the last with Guillermo sisters who  live side by side&nbsp;in a quiet colonia on the outskirts of Comayagua. We did a  little shopping and made our customary evening visit to the city plaza. Up on  the farm, we toured the coffee, talked about "la roya" a lot (see the next  section for more on the spread and impact of coffee rust),&nbsp;enjoyed freshly baked  bread and many cups of coffee,&nbsp;and generally passed the time in steady  conversation and story telling. Mostly the weather was pleasantly warm, but a  cold front did come through bringing chilly rain for a&nbsp;couple of days.  Thankfully, Guillermo's brother Avilio had recently built a charming fireplace  in his house to hold off the damp chill.</p> <p>As hoped, we were able to give a financial update to the family and we  negotiated quantity and price for our next coffee shipment. We also worked out a payment schedule works for all of  us, providing them with funds when they need it most and&nbsp;giving us more cash  flow flexibility and predictability.</p> <p><span style="color: #800000;"><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>"La Roya" - A National  Emergency<br /></strong></span><span style="color: #000000;">As we mentioned above, the talk everywhere we went was the outbreak of "La Roya", coffee rust, that  is&nbsp;devastating coffee harvests throughout Central America. La roya appears as an  orange dust on the leaves compromising the plant's ability to photosynthesize  and thus produce coffee berries. Leaves drop and berries&nbsp;are mostly empty.  Instead of their usual lush green, coffee plantations are left looking like dead  sticks poking out of the ground. And farmers are left without a harvest. </span></span><span style="color: #800000;"><span style="color: #000000;">The governments of  Guatemala, Honduras and Costa Rica have declared <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57568519/guatemala-declares-national-coffee-emergency/" target="_blank">national  emergencies</a> over the plague&nbsp;that threatens the livelihoods of coffee  farmers, the farm workers who pick the coffee and the fragile economies of this  region&nbsp;that depend largely on coffee exports. La roya isn't new (Guillermo's  father, Maximo, was hard hit when it wiped out his crop back in the 80's), but  this year's outbreak is being called the worst ever in this part of the world. </span></span></p> <p>There are mixed opinions on the cause. One organic coffee researcher, <a href="http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/fighting-off-the-coffee-curse/#h[MhiHhn,2]" target="_blank">John  Vandermeer</a> hypothesizes the growth of&nbsp; larger sun plantations with intensive  use of pesticides and fungicides has wiped out helpful organisms that kept the  fungus in control.&nbsp;Others take the opposite position, pointing to poor  management and patchy use of <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/coffee-rust-regains-foothold-1.12320" target="_blank">fungicides</a> that had kept the disease under control until now. Many point to <a href="http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/fighting-off-the-coffee-curse/#h[MhiHhn,2]" target="_blank">changing  rainfall </a>patterns due to climate change.&nbsp;Guillermo's brothers said they  experienced days of light rain, then sun, then more rain&nbsp;etc -- and the constant  mix of moisture and heat created&nbsp;the ideal&nbsp;situation for the fungus to  spread.&nbsp;(They are also seeing changes in the annual coffee plant cycle. We saw a  few trees that were already blooming, something that usually happens in May or  June, meaning some of the coffee could be ready to harvest as early as September  this year instead of the usual November and December!)</p> <p>Although, many of the government responses to the coffee&nbsp;rust&nbsp;crisis involve  funds to buy fungicides, there is doubt that they will be effective. What is  really needed and what our family members have been doing, is cutting down the  infected plants and planting <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/coffee-rust-regains-foothold-1.12320" target="_blank">new  varieties</a> that are more resistent. But this is a hard solution because it  means waiting 3-4 years for new plants to begin producing. Thankfully for our  family (and for your coffee supply), a good portion of their coffee already  included coffee varieties&nbsp;that are resistent to the fungus.&nbsp;We saw bare plants  (mostly of the Catura varieties that are being hit hard) right next lush green  plants with healthy&nbsp;coffee production (these were of Catimor varieties like  Lempira and Cafe 90 that had been developed in Honduras). So we are quite  hopeful we will have&nbsp;a steady coffee supply&nbsp;this year and next. Even as we feel  for&nbsp;the many farmers throughout the region that are facing a tragedy.</p> <p>In addition to our trip <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.424793174274179.1073741825.322870731133091&amp;type=1&amp;l=ca2639209f" target="_blank">slideshow</a>,  we've linked to lots of great articles and videos about this situation on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/VelasquezFamilyCoffee" target="_blank">Facebook&nbsp;page</a>.&nbsp;(Check  it out, and while you are there be sure to "like" us and share us with your  friends.)</p>  </div>
