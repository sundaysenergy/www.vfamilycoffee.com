    <p>-Fair Trade Coffee Harvest Challenges<br />-Celebrate Earth Day<br /> *Really Recycled Invoices<br /> *Earthy Events<br /> *Buy Direct from the farm</p>
<p><strong><font color="#800000">Fair Trade Coffee Harvest   Challenges</font></strong><br />In Honduras, the coffee harvest is pretty much     finished, so we're making arrangements to have it imported to Minnesota in the     next few months. Even though we have been getting and selling coffee from our     family for nearly 10 years now there are still a number of challenges we face   in   getting it from the coffee farm to your coffee cup. (If you'd like to delve into     the issues a bit deeper, check out this interesting article about <a href="http://www.alternet.org/food/145555/does_fair_trade_coffee_lift_growers_out_of_poverty_or_simply_ease_our_guilty_conscience">Fair     Trade coffee</a> that Cathy's brother emailed us recently.)</p>
<p><em>Labor</em> - Finding temporary workers to help pick coffee can be a real     challenge when every other coffee farmer in the country is looking for workers     at the same moment. It has gotten even harder in recent years, since many young     men have made the trip north to the United States or to the Honduran coast to     work in the maquiladora factories that make your T-shirts and such. Our family     members work hard to pay good wages and provide good living conditions; and   somehow they manage to find people to help them each year. But it is often   stressful at the height of the harvest when the coffee is ripe and threatened   by   heavy rains and workers have not yet been found.</p>
<p><em>Drying and Processing Coffee</em> - Coffee sold on the open market can   be   sold wet or even still in the coffee berry. To send coffee to us, our family     members need to take several additional steps to dry and hull the coffee beans.     This is especially challenging when your coffee farm is in a rain forest and   the   coffee harvest coincides with the winter rainy season. Some of our family   members are experimenting (somewhat successfully) with green houses and fans   to   dry their coffee. When we were in Honduras in January, we also talked about   pooling funds as a family to purchase land in the valley (where the climate is     warmer and dryer) to have cement patios available for drying coffee.</p>
<p><em>Fluctuating Prices</em> - The reality of commodities is that prices on     the open market fluctuate wildly. When we started this business, coffee prices     were at an all time low, about .50/lb. They have bounced up and down over the     years and this year are quite high -- at about $1.40/lb -- which is actually     above the Fair Trade price floor of $1.21 (see the <a href="http://www.alternet.org/food/145555/does_fair_trade_coffee_lift_growers_out_of_poverty_or_simply_ease_our_guilty_conscience">article</a> for more on this). Throughout this time, we have steadily paid our family   members $2.20/lb, but with the extra costs (and work) of drying and processing     and preparing coffee for export, this year they aren't really making that much     more from us than they might if they just sold it to the local coffee buyer.   But   knowing this is a long-term venture, our family is committed to reserving coffee     for us to sell here. And we will continue to evaluate the price we pay them to     make sure it continues to be fair.</p>
<p>The exporting and importing process is also complex and something we are   learning a lot about right now, because for the first time we are hoping to   serve as our own importer rather than shipping our coffee with one of   Guillermo's cousins as we have done in the past. We'll write more in future   emails about that part of the process (after we've hopefully figured it all   out).</p>
<p><strong><font color="#800000">Celebrating Earth Day</font></strong><br />The 40th     anniversary of the first Earth Day is coming up this April 22. We thought we'd     share a few of our ideas for celebrating Mother Earth.</p>
<p>-<em>Really Recycled Invoices</em> -- Over the years we've accumulated a   stack of scrap paper with just one side used (a habit Cathy learned from her     mom), that is now taller than the stack of new recycled paper that we usually     use for our invoices. So -- to save trees and money and maybe just make getting     your invoice a bit more interesting (what will be on the back of yours this   month?) -- we're going to start printing our invoices on scrap paper.</p>
<p>-<em>Earthy Events</em> -- There are LOTS of great <a href="http://www.nextstep.state.mn.us/calendar.cfm">green events</a> this time     of the year. Here are three that we'll be attending. Stop by and say   Hi.<br /> *Sat. April 17, 9-4 - The World Jubilee (lots of great fair trade     products),Â  Gloria Dei Lutheran Church, 700 Snelling Ave S., St. Paul   <br /> *Thurs. April 22, 11-3 - First Street Towers Earth Day Fair, Skyway     level, 100 South Fifth Street in downtown Minneapolis. <br /> *Sat &amp;     Sun, May 1 (10-6) &amp; May 2 (10-5) -- Living Green Expo, MN State Fair   Grounds. <a href="http://www.livinggreenexpo.mn/">http://www.livinggreenexpo.mn/</a></p>
<p>-<em>Buy Direct from the Farm</em> -- We just learned of <a href="http://www.mirasolfarm.com/Welcome.html">Mirasol Farm</a> Bath and Body     products, "earthbound pleasures" created by some of our long-time coffee   customers. We encourage you to check our their <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/mirasolfarm">all natural soaps and lotions</a>.     If you are looking for food from the farm -- check out Land Stewardship   Project's <a href="http://www.landstewardshipproject.org/csa.html">CSA   Directory</a> and <a href="http://www.landstewardshipproject.org/foodfarm-main.html#sfd">Stewardship     Farm Directory</a>.</p>
<p><strong><font color="#800000">Alonzo's Bourbon Coffee and on-sale Holiday   Flavors still available<br /></font></strong>Alonzo's heirloom bourbon coffee was     very well received last month, so we will continue to offer it until it runs   out   (we have about 400 lbs so it should last for a while). We've roasted it a bit     darker than last month -- a "Vienna Roast" our <a href="http://76.164.129.95/ProductCart/pc/viewcontent.asp?idpage=1">roaster</a> calls it -- to contrast it with the lighter Alma's "Full City", but it's still     lighter than our darkest Maximo's "French Roast". As before it is packaged in   12   oz bags either ground or whole bean for $8.50 a bag. 5 lb bulk bags and   unroasted green beans of the bourbon are also available by special request.</p>
<p>And yes, there are still a few more bags of our December holiday flavors   available -- now available for $4.50/each or any five discounted bags for $20.     Complete descriptions and an updated count of how much is left can be found on     the homepage of our <a href="../index.html">website</a>.</p>
<p><strong><font color="#800000">Tear Off Posters</font></strong><br />Finally,   thanks to those of you who requested posters last month to help promote our   coffee. If you'd like one (or a few) to hang up at work, in your apartment, at     school or in your place of worship, just let us know, we can print up more.</p>  </div>
