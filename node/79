    <p>-Maximo &amp; Natalia return to Honduras<br />-Holiday Gift ideas and Holiday flavors<br />-New prices in 2008</p><p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Back to Honduras<br /></span></strong>Guillermo's parents, Maximo and Natalia, with impecable timing, headed back   to Honduras just days before the temperature really dropped and the snow started   to pile up. Before they left, we enjoyed several large family gatherings to  celebrate Maximo's 82nd birthday and Thanksgiving. The contrast was extreme when   we went from setting the table for 15 to a very quiet 3 as Guillermo and our   middle son Jake went along to help manuever airports and luggage.</p> <p>Guillermo reports more fun family gatherings and lovely 70 degree  weather in Comayagua but rain and muddy roads on the farm up in the  mountains. Winter in Honduras means rain so that is to be expected. We look   forward to more news and photos from the family and farm when he and Jake return   tomorrow night. (We are in the process of creating a photo gallery on our  website. So look for a link to lots of photos in our January  email.)</p> <p>We made sure Guillermo would be back to help with the December order  (typically our largest each year) coming up this week. Our fresh roast arrives   from the roaster on Wednesday. Let us know if you are interested in coffee this   month.</p> <p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Holiday Gift Packs<br /></span></strong>Let us know   if we can help with your holiday shopping. We can deliver or ship coffee   for gifts directly to you. Or make it even easier and let us do the shipping   too.We can mail coffee (with your personal note included too if you wish)  anywhere in the country with only the added cost of priority mail postage. We   ship over 30 boxes of coffee every month anyway, so we're all set up to  do  it. Just email us the details before we pack up our orders on December 13th (how   much, of what kind of coffee, sent to where) and we'll take care of the  rest.</p> <p>And here is another gift idea - order a 3, 6 or 12 month coffee  subscription for someone. We've put together a colorful gift certificate that   can be customized for any occasion. (Buy now and you'll get our 2007 prices  before they increase in 2008.)</p> <p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Fair Trade Coffee Mugs</span></strong><br />Make   your coffee gift extra special and include a beautiful fair trade coffee mug   from <a href="http://www.lazosties.com/">Lazos/Ties</a>. We are pleased to be   partnering with this Minnesota based fair trade business that offers beautiful   handcrafted fair trade coffee mugs, espresso cups, cream and sugar sets and  coffee pots that will go very nicely in a gift pack with Velasquez Family  Coffee. All items are dishwasher and microwave safe. We've uploaded photos,  prices and more details about the Mexican artisans to our website at <a href="../holidays">www.vfamilycoffee.com/holidays</a>.   <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">But place your order as soon as possible as their products have been   popular and supply right now is very limited!</span></strong> If we get your order   in time (before they run out and before our shipments), we'll deliver or ship   them to you with your coffee order.</p> <p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Holiday Flavors a big  hit<br /></span></strong>We've had great feedback about the holiday flavors --  so  place your order now while supplies last (after December we won't be  reordering). As a reminder here is the list:</p> <p><strong><em>Kahlua</em></strong> -<span> Similar to the   liqueur. Gourmet Kahlua flavoring combined with rich coffee to produce a  refreshing brew, great as iced coffee or after  dinner.<br /></span><strong><em>Eggnog Cream</em></strong> - <span>A warm, spicy Eggnog with a rich Custard finish. (This was   so popular last year, we're bringing it back!)<br /></span><strong><em>English   Toffee</em></strong> - <span>A tad of caramel, a touch of   chocolate, a spot of cream, very British, very buttery, very  good.<br /></span><strong><em>Pumpkin Spice</em></strong> - <span>Nutmeg and pumpkin flavors make this the perfect flavored   coffee for those chilly mornings or in front of the fire.</span></p> <p><span>We also have a limited amount of <em>Pumpkin  Spice</em> and <em>English Toffee</em> in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Decaf</span>. And don't forget we  still have all our regular flavors: African Cinnamon, Almond Amaretto, Carribean   Hazelnut, Dutch Chocolate, French Vanilla and Irish Cream. (Look for  Jamaica Me Crazy and Chocolate Hazelnut Cream to appear in February in time for   Valentine's day!)</span></p> <p>All flavored coffee is available in 8 oz bags, whole bean or ground<em> </em>for $5.50.</p> <p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Green Coffee &amp; Espresso  Grind<br /></span></strong>A couple new products are being rolled out. For those   of you who are interested in roasting your own coffee (or know people who have   their own home roaster), we currently sell green unroasted coffee in 5# bags  for  $25.</p> <p>Also, although a number of our customers tell us that our Maximo French Roast   already works great for making espresso, we have also had interest in providing   a finer espresso grind. We don't have this ready yet, but if you are interested   in purchasing our Maximo's French Roast in a finer grind, let us know so we know   how much to order in January.</p> <p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">New Prices in January</span><br /></strong>After   much contemplation and delay, we are finally, really, really going to raise  prices starting January 1, 2008. Based on the feedback we've received  from our customers, 12 oz bags will be $8.50 and 8 oz flavored bags will  go  to $6.00. 5# bulk bags, wholesale and fundraiser pricing is still being  finalized but will be based in part on quantity purchased. Thanks to your  understanding and support as we make this difficult decision.</p> <p>And thanks for your interest in Velasquez Family Coffee!! We are very  grateful for the opportunity to build new connections across borders.</p>  </div>
