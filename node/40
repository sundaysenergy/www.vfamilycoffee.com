    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">-Hurricanes and Disaster Prevention<br />-Visitors to the Coffee Farm<br />-Credit Card purchases<br />-New Prices<br />-Flavor Votes</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;"><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Hurricanes and Disaster Prevention</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">October   has arrived and so have beautiful colored leaves and shorter days. But where  are  the crisp cool temperatures we usually have? It is a steamy 82 degrees here in   Minnesota at the moment. Having  watched <em><a href="http://www.climatecrisis.net/">Inconvenient Truth</a></em> for the second time recently, it is hard not to think of global warming when  it  is so uncharacteristically warm this fall. The hurricanes that hit Central  America last month (and some of the damaging wind storms that knocked down trees   near us here in MN) seemed to be a reminder too.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">Thankfully,   our family and the coffee farms were not impacted by the most recent  hurricanes. (Thanks to all of you who asked about them.) However, if you are   interested in helping reduce the impact of future hurricanes and perhaps even   putting a dent in the daunting problem of climate change, we encourage you   to check out and support one of our favorite organizations working in Central   America -- <a href="http://www.sustainableharvest.org/">Sustainable Harvest  International</a>. As they put it in their latest newsletter, they are not in   the business of disaster relief, but disaster prevention.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">Their   Honduran field trainer, Juan Carlos Sandres writes, "After the experience of   devastation in my country from Hurricane Mitch in 1998, Sustainable Harvest  Honduras has been dedicated to sharing agro-forestry techniques with families   that were impacted by the disaster. We have been able to improve many vulnerable   areas through soil conservation, reforestation, crop diversification and  disaster prevention training. We know that when there are natural disasters,  the  families we work with are more resilient and their parcels of land are much less   susceptible to erosion and crop loss."</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">You   can visit SHI's website at <a href="http://www.sustainableharvest.org/">www.sustainableharvest.org</a> to   learn more about this hard working organization.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">We're   hoping that the reforestation and erosion prevention measures that our family   members practice on their coffee farms will help protect them from future  disasters as well!</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;"><span style="color: maroon;"><strong>Visitors to the Coffee Farm</strong></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">This past month, we were happy to hear from some   recent visitors to the Velasquez family coffee farm. This summer,  a group of college students from St. Olaf College in Northfield, MN  (Cathy's alma mater) had the opportunity to travel to Honduras. Thanks to  a  chance encounter at the Living Green Expo with the organizer of the group,   we helped make arrangements for them to visit Guillermo's brother's farm. They   left us the following messages about their trip</p> <blockquote style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr"><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;"><em>"I     just visited Abilio and his family a few weeks ago with a group from St. Olaf     College. I just wanted to say thank you for a wonderful experience! Keep up     the environmentally friendly work!"</em></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><em>"Thank you so much for    helping to facilitate the St. Olaf group experience down at Abilioâs farm in     Honduras. We had an absolutely    phenomenal time. I think we all wish we could have spent more time there.    Thank you very much for setting it up."</em></p></blockquote> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">In follow-up to their trip, they   also invited us to participate in a Homecoming event last weekend to sell   our coffee. We're excited to be making these new and old connections.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">This week another friend of ours   has arrived in Honduras and has made plans to visit the farm and stay in one  of  the "eco-casitas" (cabins) up in the mountain. If you are interested in an  authentic visit to a working coffee farm in a cloud forest, let us know  and  we'd be happy to help you get connected with our family members there.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;"><span style="color: maroon;"><strong>Credit Card purchases</strong></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;"><span style="color: maroon;"><span style="color: #000000;">As we mentioned last month, our  website now accepts credit cards! But it also automatically charges you  for  postage. So if you would like to pay with a credit card for the coffee we   deliver for free to your home, let us know and we'll send you a PayPal invoice   (you don't need to have a PayPal account). At the moment, this seems to  be  the easiest and least expensive way for us to offer this convenience to  our  monthly customers.</span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;"><span style="color: maroon;"><strong>New prices</strong></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">As  we  suggested in our last email, we are considering increasing our prices and we   asked for your feedback. We were humbled by  the overwhelmingly positive feedback we received. Here is a bit of what  we  heard from you:</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;"><em>"I   am happy to pay you more for your coffee."</em></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;"><em>"You   need to charge what you need."</em></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;"><em>"You   have our support in raising the price of the coffee. It is the best!"</em></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;"><em>"I   agree with their recommendations [of the U of M grad students to raise your  prices.] I also like the credit card option and would be willing to pay extra  to  cover those costs. I typically pay the cost of a stamp to send you a check, so   that money might as well go to you all. I would be willing to pay up to $8.50   per bag if I could pay by credit card and keep the delivery option."</em></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;"><em>"Raising   the cost per pound of your coffee slightly will not cause me to stop buying your   coffee. The quality is such that it is still a significant bargain at the 'new'   suggested price. I know that one is in business to make a living. It looks like   you are responsible for the livelihood of a lot of different people from your   growers through you, and based on your break down, it does not appear that  anyone is getting rich. I hope that you, and your family growers, achieve a  sufficient enough volume to be able to continue paying your overhead costs and   save up a little for your retirement. Unless I have run out, I have not  purchased other coffee from any other supplier. I enjoy the coffee and your  business model is about as close as I have seen to handing my money directly  to  the farmer/grower for coffee. Thank you for providing the opportunity to  purchase your coffee."</em></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">Wow!   With that kind of feedback, we decided to sit down and rework our price   structure. Look for us to roll that out in the coming months.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;"><span style="color: maroon;"><strong>Flavor Votes</strong></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">Here   is another fun way for you to provide us with some input. The holidays are just   around the corner and we'd like to offer some special new flavors  again, but we need your input to help us decide. Take a look at the long   list of possible flavors that our roaster can do on their website at: <a href="http://www.europeanroasterie.com/Default.asp?Page=105">http://www.europeanroasterie.com/Default.asp?Page=105</a></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">And   then email us your top three. Send us your flavor votes before October 29, and   your next bag of flavored coffee is free.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">We   are grateful for your regular purchases and your input. Thank you.</p>  </div>
