Before they left, we enjoyed several large family  gatherings to  celebrate Maximo's 82nd birthday and Thanksgiving. The  contrast was extreme when   we went from setting the table for 15 to a  very quiet 3 as Guillermo and our   middle son Jake went along to help  manuever airports and luggage.</p> <p>Guillermo reports more fun family  gatherings and lovely 70 degree  weather in Comayagua but rain and  muddy roads on the farm up in the  mountains. Winter in Honduras means  rain so that is to be expected. We look   forward to more news and  photos from the family and farm when he and Jake return   tomorrow  night. (We are in the process of creating a photo gallery on our   website. So look for a link to lots of photos in our January  email.)</p> <p>We made sure Guillermo would be back to help with the December order   (typically our largest each year) coming up this week. Our fresh roast  arrives   from the roaster on Wednesday. Let us know if you are  interested in coffee this   month.</p> <p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Holiday  Gift Packs<br /></span></strong>Let us know   if we can help with your  holiday shopping. We can deliver or ship coffee   for gifts directly to  you. Or make it even easier and let us do the shipping   too.We can mail  coffee (with your personal note included too if you wish)  anywhere in  the country with only the added cost of priority mail postage. We   ship  over 30 boxes of coffee every month anyway, so we're all set up to  do   it. Just email us the details before we pack up our orders on December  13th (how   much, of what kind of coffee, sent to where) and we'll take  care of the  rest.</p> <p>And here is another gift idea - order a 3, 6  or 12 month coffee  subscription for someone. We've put together a  colorful gift certificate that   can be customized for any occasion.  (Buy now and you'll get our 2007 prices  before they increase in 2008.)</p> <p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Fair Trade Coffee Mugs</span></strong><br />Make    your coffee gift extra special and include a beautiful fair trade  coffee mug   from <a href="http://www.lazosties.com/">Lazos/Ties</a>. We are pleased to  be   partnering with this Minnesota based fair trade business that  offers beautiful   handcrafted fair trade coffee mugs, espresso cups,  cream and sugar sets and  coffee pots that will go very nicely in a gift  pack with Velasquez Family  Coffee. All items are dishwasher and  microwave safe. We've uploaded photos,  prices and more details about  the Mexican artisans to our website at <a href="../holidays">www.vfamilycoffee.com/holidays</a>.    <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">But place your order as soon as possible as their products  have been   popular and supply right now is very limited!</span></strong> If we get your order   in time (before they run out and before our  shipments), we'll deliver or ship   them to you with your coffee order.</p> <p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Holiday Flavors a big  hit<br /></span></strong>We've  had great feedback about the holiday flavors --  so  place your order  now while supplies last (after December we won't be  reordering). As a  reminder here is the list:</p> <p><strong><em>Kahlua</em></strong> -<span> Similar to the   liqueur. Gourmet Kahlua  flavoring combined with rich coffee to produce a  refreshing brew, great  as iced coffee or after  dinner.<br /></span><strong><em>Eggnog Cream</em></strong> - <span>A warm, spicy Eggnog with a rich Custard  finish. (This was   so popular last year, we're bringing it back!)<br /></span><strong><em>English    Toffee</em></strong> - <span>A tad of caramel,  a touch of   chocolate, a spot of cream, very British, very buttery,  very  good.<br /></span><strong><em>Pumpkin Spice</em></strong> - <span>Nutmeg and pumpkin flavors make this the perfect  flavored   coffee for those chilly mornings or in front of the fire.</span></p> <p><span>We also have a limited amount of <em>Pumpkin   Spice</em> and <em>English Toffee</em> in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Decaf</span>. And don't  forget we  still have all our regular flavors: African Cinnamon, Almond  Amaretto, Carribean   Hazelnut, Dutch Chocolate, French Vanilla and  Irish Cream. (Look for  Jamaica Me Crazy and Chocolate Hazelnut Cream to  appear in February in time for   Valentine's day!)</span></p> <p>All  flavored coffee is available in 8 oz bags, whole bean or ground<em> </em>for  $5.50.</p> <p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Green Coffee &amp; Espresso   Grind<br /></span></strong>A couple new products are being rolled out.  For those   of you who are interested in roasting your own coffee (or  know people who have   their own home roaster), we currently sell green  unroasted coffee in 5# bags  for  $25.</p> <p>Also, although a number  of our customers tell us that our Maximo French Roast   already works  great for making espresso, we have also had interest in providing   a  finer espresso grind. We don't have this ready yet, but if you are  interested   in purchasing our Maximo's French Roast in a finer grind,  let us know so we know   how much to order in January.</p> <p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">New Prices in January</span><br /></strong>After   much  contemplation and delay, we are finally, really, really going to raise   prices starting January 1, 2008. Based on the feedback we've received   from our customers, 12 oz bags will be $8.50 and 8 oz flavored bags will   go  to $6.00. 5# bulk bags, wholesale and fundraiser pricing is still  being  finalized but will be based in part on quantity purchased. Thanks  to your  understanding and support as we make this difficult decision.</p> <p>And thanks for your interest in Velasquez Family Coffee!! We are  very  grateful for the opportunity to build new connections across  borders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #800000;">December 2007&nbsp; - special gift ideas edition<br /></span></strong></span></p><p>There are several great alternative shopping opportunities coming up   in  the next few days that we thought some of our customers might be  interested  in.</p><p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Benefit Shopping  Night - </span></strong>Wednesday, November 28 5-8 pm - Buy a burrito  at Chipotle and   shop fair trade items at Ten Thousand Villages and  benefit the Land Stewardship   Project.

While the tradition there does NOT include going door  to door to get  candy, they do remember going to visit friends and  family and asking for -- get  this -- squash! Cooked squash with "dulce"  (a by-product of processing sugar  cane, much like brown sugar in a  block). Natalia even sang us a little song they  used to sing asking for  squash and blessing the angels ("los angelitos") of the  house.</p> <p>The  angels make sense, given that in Honduras the real focus of these first   few days of November is about remembering the dead. This week, the  cemetaries  are full of people putting flowers on the graves of their  loved ones. Natalia  typically gathers all the flowers from her own  beloved garden and brings them to  the cemetary in the small town of La  Cuesta where her parents and Maximo's  parents are buried. Guillermo's  oldest sister Chela will probably make the visit  this year while  Natalia is here in Minnesota.</p><p><img title="Cemetary in La Cuesta" src="../files/vfamily/u4/IMG_4322.jpg" alt="Cemetary in La Cuesta" width="300" height="225" />&nbsp;</p><p><img title="Rodriguez Family monument (Natalia's  parents)" src="../files/vfamily/u4/IMG_4323.jpg" alt="Rodriguez Family monument  (Natalia's parents)" width="300" height="225" />&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">And  the winner is...<br /></span></strong>Over 30  people voted in our  holiday flavor survey last week. Based on your votes, we  will be  offering the following special flavors over the holiday season:</p> <p><strong><em>Kahlua</em></strong> -<span> Similar to the  liqueur. Gourmet Kahlua  flavoring combined with rich coffee to produce a  refreshing brew, great  as iced coffee or after  dinner.<br /></span><strong><em>Eggnog Cream</em></strong> - <span>A warm, spicy Eggnog with a rich Custard  finish. (This was  so popular last year, we're bringing it back!)<br /></span><strong><em>English   Toffee</em></strong> - <span>A tad of caramel, a  touch of  chocolate, a spot of cream, very British, very buttery, very   good.<br /></span><strong><em>Pumpkin Spice</em></strong> - <span>Nutmeg and pumpkin flavors make this the perfect  flavored  coffee for those chilly mornings or in front of the fire.<br />We  will also have a  limited amount of <em>Pumpkin Spice</em> and <em>English  Toffee</em> in  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Decaf</span>. </span></p> <p>Let us know if you'd like  to order any of our flavored coffee this month or  next. We'll have it  available in 8 oz bags, whole bean or ground<em> </em>for  $5.50 through  December and then only while supplies last. (Jamaica Me Crazy,  Spice  Buttered Rum, Chocolate Hazelnut Cream, and Cinnamon Hazelnut were close   runners-up and so we may be offering them too in the coming months.)  And don't  forget we still have all our regular flavors: African  Cinnamon, Almond Amaretto,  Carribean Hazelnut, Dutch Chocolate, French  Vanilla and Irish Cream.</p> <p>If you were one of those who voted in  our survey (Thank you!) - we've got  your name and your first bag will  be marked as free on your invoice. But you  will have to order to  receive it.</p> <p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Holiday Orders<br /></span></strong>Talking  about  the holidays, we probably don't need to remind you that coffee  does make an  excellent gift. We'd be happy to help make your holiday  shopping easier if we  can -- let us know what extra coffee you want for  gifts before our December  14/15 delivery date and we'll bring it right  to your door. We can also mail  coffee (with your personal note  included too if you wish) anywhere in the  country with only the added  cost of priority mail postage. We ship over 30 boxes  of coffee every  month anyway, so we're all set up to do it. Just email us the  details  (how much of what kind of coffee sent to where) and we'll take care of   it for you.</p> <p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Other Unique Holiday  Gifts</span></strong><br />We  will be attending two upcoming events that  also provide great oppotunities for  finding unique gifts. <strong>Tomorrow</strong>,  November 3, from 9:00-3:00 our  church, <a href="http://www.prospectparkchurch.org/">Prospect Park United   Methodist Church</a> will be holding it's very popular <em><strong>Art  Fair and  Bazaar</strong></em> with pottery, jewelry, music, cards,  weaving, quilts,  photography, tie dye, home-baked goods, baskets and  more. The church is located  at 22 Orlin Ave SE in Minneapolis, 1 block  south of University Avenue, just west  of Hwy 280 (turn south on Malcolm  by Tower Hill).</p> <p>On Saturday, November 17, from 9:00-4:00 <strong><em>the  World  Jubilee's</em></strong> fall sale will be held at the Colonial  Church of Edina  (6200 Colonial Way in Edina). This is a fabulous  collection of fair trade  products from all over the world. And sales  directly benefit the disadvantaged  people who have made the items.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #800000;">October 2007 Coffee News</span></strong></span></p><p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Hurricanes and Disaster  Prevention</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">October   has arrived  and so have beautiful colored leaves and shorter days. But where  are   the crisp cool temperatures we usually have? It is a steamy 82 degrees  here in   Minnesota at the moment. Having  watched <em><a href="http://www.climatecrisis.net/">Inconvenient Truth</a></em> for the second time recently, it is hard not to think of global warming  when  it  is so uncharacteristically warm this fall. The hurricanes that  hit Central  America last month (and some of the damaging wind storms  that knocked down trees   near us here in MN) seemed to be a reminder  too.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">Thankfully,   our family and the coffee farms were not  impacted by the most recent  hurricanes. (Thanks to all of you who  asked about them.) However, if you are   interested in helping reduce  the impact of future hurricanes and perhaps even   putting a dent in the  daunting problem of climate change, we encourage you   to check out and  support one of our favorite organizations working in Central   America  -- <a href="http://www.sustainableharvest.org/">Sustainable Harvest   International</a>. As they put it in their latest newsletter, they are  not in   the business of disaster relief, but disaster prevention.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">Their   Honduran field trainer, Juan Carlos Sandres  writes, "After the experience of   devastation in my country from  Hurricane Mitch in 1998, Sustainable Harvest  Honduras has been  dedicated to sharing agro-forestry techniques with families   that were  impacted by the disaster. We have been able to improve many vulnerable    areas through soil conservation, reforestation, crop diversification  and  disaster prevention training. We know that when there are natural  disasters,  the  families we work with are more resilient and their  parcels of land are much less   susceptible to erosion and crop loss."</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">You   can visit SHI's website at <a href="http://www.sustainableharvest.org/">www.sustainableharvest.org</a> to   learn more about this hard working organization.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">We're    hoping that the reforestation and erosion prevention measures that  our family   members practice on their coffee farms will help protect  them from future  disasters as well!</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;"><span style="color: maroon;"><strong>Visitors to  the Coffee Farm</strong></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">This past month, we were  happy to hear from some   recent visitors to the Velasquez family  coffee farm. This summer,  a group of college students from St. Olaf  College in Northfield, MN  (Cathy's alma mater) had the opportunity to  travel to Honduras. Thanks to  a  chance encounter at the Living Green  Expo with the organizer of the group,   we helped make arrangements for  them to visit Guillermo's brother's farm. They   left us the following  messages about their trip</p> <blockquote style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr"><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;"><em>"I     just visited  Abilio and his family a few weeks ago with a group from St. Olaf      College. I just wanted to say thank you for a wonderful experience! Keep  up     the environmentally friendly work!"</em></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><em>"Thank  you so much for    helping to facilitate the St. Olaf group experience  down at Abilioâs farm in     Honduras. We had an absolutely     phenomenal time. I think we all wish we could have spent more time  there.    Thank you very much for setting it up."</em></p></blockquote> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">In follow-up to their trip, they   also invited us to  participate in a Homecoming event last weekend to sell   our coffee.  We're excited to be making these new and old connections.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">This week another  friend of ours   has arrived in Honduras and has made plans to visit the  farm and stay in one  of  the "eco-casitas" (cabins) up in the  mountain. If you are interested in an  authentic visit to a working  coffee farm in a cloud forest, let us know  and  we'd be happy to help  you get connected with our family members there.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;"><span style="color: maroon;"><strong>New prices</strong></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">As  we  suggested  in our last email, we are considering increasing our prices and we    asked for your feedback. We were humbled by  the overwhelmingly positive  feedback we received. Here is a bit of what  we  heard from you:</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;"><em>"I   am happy to pay you more for your coffee."</em></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;"><em>"You   need to charge what you need."</em></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;"><em>"You    have our support in raising the price of the coffee. It is the best!"</em></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;"><em>"I   agree with their recommendations [of the U of  M grad students to raise your  prices.] I also like the credit card  option and would be willing to pay extra  to  cover those costs. I  typically pay the cost of a stamp to send you a check, so   that money  might as well go to you all. I would be willing to pay up to $8.50   per  bag if I could pay by credit card and keep the delivery option."</em></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;"><em>"Raising   the cost per pound of your coffee  slightly will not cause me to stop buying your   coffee. The quality is  such that it is still a significant bargain at the 'new'   suggested  price. I know that one is in business to make a living. It looks like    you are responsible for the livelihood of a lot of different people from  your   growers through you, and based on your break down, it does not  appear that  anyone is getting rich. I hope that you, and your family  growers, achieve a  sufficient enough volume to be able to continue  paying your overhead costs and   save up a little for your retirement.  Unless I have run out, I have not  purchased other coffee from any other  supplier. I enjoy the coffee and your  business model is about as close  as I have seen to handing my money directly  to  the farmer/grower for  coffee. Thank you for providing the opportunity to  purchase your  coffee."</em></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">Wow!   With that kind of  feedback, we decided to sit down and rework our price   structure. Look  for us to roll that out in the coming months. We   are grateful for  your regular purchases and your input. Thank you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #800000;"><a name="SEPT07"></a>September 2007 Coffee News</span></strong></span></p><p><span style="color: maroon;"><strong>News  from the Coffee Farm</strong></span></p><div class="moz-text-html"><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">The  news from the coffee farm is that Guillermo's   brother Abilio has been  working on a mini-hydroelectric project. For years we   have talked  about harnessing the water power of the nearby Rio Negro (a small   but  quickly moving stream that flows through the farm) by channeling water    through pipes to fall onto a small turbine connected to a small  generator.  Finally, this project is moving forward and the family looks  forward to   adding a few light bulbs to the house and perhaps the  "luxury" of  refrigeration.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;"><span style="color: maroon;"><strong>On-line buying</strong></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">At  a  different level of technology advancement, we  have finally, finally entered the   world of on-line commerce. The VFC  website -- <a href="//">www.vfamilycoffee.com</a> --  now accepts   credit card orders! In the next month, we also hope to  add a feature for our   regular monthly customers to pay on-line too, or  if you wish, to enable us to   charge your regular orders to your  credit card. Let us know if you would be  interested in this  convenience.</p> <p><span style="color: maroon;"><strong>Walk for Justice and  Stewardship</strong><br /></span>On  September 16, Cathy will have the opportunity   to participate in the <a href="http://walkforjustice.org/">Walk for Justice</a> on behalf  of <a href="http://www.landstewardshipproject.org/">Land Stewardship    Project</a>. She'll walk with 2000 other walkers representing over  120   progressive organizations from around the area.

Last month we   promised a break down on the  costs that go into a typical bag of coffee - so   here they are. We  think it is only fair that if we claim to offer "fair trade"   coffee,  you know how your money is spent.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">We   sell most of our  coffee in 12 oz bags for $8.00 so we will use that for our  breakdown.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">A   typical 12 oz bag of roasted coffee uses about 1  lb of green unroasted coffee   (the roasting burns off some of the  moisture in the bean) for which we  pay our family member who grew it  $2.50. (They use this to pay their   workers to harvest the coffee and  keep the fields clean of weeds, to pay for  and  transport organic  fertilizers, to pay for a processor to clean and dry the  coffee, to buy  bags, and to invest back in the farm with new coffee plants  -- with  hopefully a bit left for family expenses as well).</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">The   coffee  travels by boat from Honduras to Miami and then by truck to Minnesota.   In  2007, this cost us $.26 per pound for transportation and customs.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">We   pay our roaster (and label printer) $1.22 per 12  oz bag for roasting, packaging   and labeling.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">Beyond   that, we  have all of the other additional expenses of running a business:   computers and office supplies, telephone and website service, some  minimal  marketing expenses and rent for storing our roasted coffee in a  small store  room. For home deliveries, we have the extra cost of gas  and miles on our car.   For mail orders, we offer a 10% discount for  monthly subscriptions. For   credit card purchases, we are charged .30  per transaction plus 2.9%. For   our wholesale and fundraiser customers,  we charge $6.00 per 12 oz bag ($4.00  per  bag goes back to the  fundraiser recipients).</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">So   far we have paid  ourselves for our time only by purchasing occasional plane  tickets to  Honduras (and of course unlimited free coffee). Depending on sales,    our hope is to start paying ourselves a modest amount in the coming  year.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">We   were fortunate to have the chance to work with a  couple of graduate students   from the Carlson School of Management a  year ago who helped us analyze some of   this financial data. Their  recommendation at the time was that we needed to  raise our prices. We  are considering increasing the regular price of our  12  oz bag to $8.25  with perhaps a slight change to wholesale and fundraiser prices   as  well. But we'd welcome input from you our customers as well. What do you   think?</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">We   are grateful for  your regular purchases and your input. Thank you.</p></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #800000;"><a name="AUGUST07"></a>August 2007 Coffee News</span></strong></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;"><span style="color: maroon;"><strong>35-W Bridge Collapse</strong></span><br />Everywhere    you turn these days, people are thinking and talking about the 35W  bridge  collapse in Minneapolis. It has certainly been in our thoughts  as well,  although, thankfully, none of our family or friends were  directly involved. But   our hearts go out to the families and friends  of the victims and in particular   to one of our customers whose friend  is among those confirmed as dead.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">From   a practical  perspective, we are grateful that the 35W bridge was not part of  our   regular coffee delivery route. However, there will be a slight change  this month   as we experiment with doing some of our August home  deliveries on Friday, August   10th and the rest on Saturday the 11th.  We now have over 60 deliveries to  do (yay!) and we're hoping that  spreading them out over two days will   make things a bit calmer. We're  also hoping to get our more than 20 mailed  orders out a bit earlier  too, dropping them off with FedEx or the Post Office  by  Saturday the  11th.</p><p><span style="color: maroon;"><strong>Global  Connections</strong><br /></span>The   Minneapolis bridge tragedy has  also proved to be a lesson of how connected   we are and how quickly  news spreads. Within a few hours of the collapse, we  received phone  calls from South Dakota, Virginia, Florida, Tennesee and even   Honduras  making sure we were all OK. It is that global connectedness (helped    along by tools such as email, cell phones, and the Web) that makes our  little   fair-trade effort possible. Globalization is not only a force  of multi-national   corporations helping the rich get richer. It is also  an opportunity for   ordinary people to bring about change. Daniel  Jaffee, in <em>Brewing  Justice</em>, quotes the president of Brazil,  Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva as  saying we need to make international trade  "a tool not only for creating   wealth, but also for its distribution."</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;"><span style="color: maroon;"><strong>More on Fair Trade</strong></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">Last    month, we promised to write more about how Velasquez Family Coffee  addresses  the  fair trade concepts of accountability, transparency and  worker  conditions. A year ago, we were pleased to be accepted into the  Coop  America Business Network and included in the <a href="http://www.coopamerica.org/pubs/greenpages/detail.cfm?key=19511">National    Green Pages</a>. (<a href="http://www.coopamerica.org/">Coop America</a> is one   of our  favorite groups and a great resource on green and <a href="http://www.coopamerica.org/programs/fairtrade/whattoknow/12waystoshopfairtrade.cfm">fair    trade</a> living.)</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">As   part of the  screening process, Coop America asked us several tough questions.   Here  are our honest answers (we believe honesty is a key part of   accountability and transparency!)</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;"><strong>Q.    Wages are only a part of fair trade.  Beyond wages, does Velasquez  Family   Coffee adhere to the other components of fair trade as  enumerated by the  Fairtrade Labelling Organisation (FLO)?</strong></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">A.   <em>Our business also reflects the following  additional fair trade  values:</em></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;"><em>Long   Term and  Stable Relationships -- By purchasing from family members, we naturally    have a permanent relationship and commitment -- both with the growers  and the   community where they farm -- that goes beyond business. But we  also make sure  to  give written documentation to family members each  year of the coffee we will  be  purchasing and the price we will pay.</em></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;"><em>Pricing   and Premium -- We pay our family members  between $2.00 and $3.00 per pound of   green coffee -- far above the  Fair trade minimum price even for organic coffee.   In 2006, we paid  $2.50.</em></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt  0in;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;"><strong>Q.   You mention  that family members are paid well.  Is there a code of conduct   or  specific labor criteria for any farm workers hired by your family   members?  What is the policy for sharing profits with these  workers?</strong></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">A.   <em>Family members are committed to good  conditions for their workers, but we,   unfortunately, do not have a  "code of conduct" or any specific "labor criteria"   for farm workers.  Nor do we have a policy for sharing profits. We would welcome   examples  of policies that other groups are using. </em></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;"><em>In    practice, the family members we purchase coffee from, have enjoyed long  term   relationships with many of their coffee workers. They pay them a  bit above the   going rate in their community, provide them with food  and housing and  transportation. For small coffee farmers like our  family members, finding enough   people to pick coffee during the  harvest season has become a challenge  especially in the last few years.  More and more people are finding work in  maquiladores factories or  leaving for the U.S. As a result, small coffee farmers   have had to  work really hard to offer attractive working conditions for their    employees, simply to have enough labor. </em></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;"><em>Yet,   we  admit, this is an area of our business that could use improvement. As we  are   able to purchase more of our family's coffee (we currently only  purchase about   half), we hope that they will be able to have the  financial stability themselves   to be able to support their workers  with higher wages. As mentioned above, we   would also recommend  examples of other standards for farm workers that our  family members  could implement.<br /></em></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">Another    part of accountability and transparency has to do with being open  about the flow   of money. Look for a break down on the costs that go  into a typical bag of  coffee next month.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #800000;"><a name="JULY07"></a>July 2007 Coffee News</span></strong></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">It's   been a full month with family gatherings and  reunions, 4th of July celebrations   and computer upgrades! But Cathy  has managed to fit in some reading time,  working herself through a book  called <em>Brewing Justice: Fair Trade Coffee,   Sustainability and  Survival</em> by Daniel Jaffee. This month we'll share a bit   from the  first chapters and over the coming months we'll add other interesting    tidbits.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">A  key  concept of Fair Trade is shortening the  trading chain by cutting out many of  the  intermediaries or middlemen  such as exporters, importers and brokers. It would   be hard to find a  "chain" much shorter than ours, unless you travel directly  to  the  coffee farm yourself.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">As   you know, our  coffee comes directly from our family in Honduras and we'll get  it   directly to you.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;"><strong><span style="color: maroon;">Key Concepts of Fair Trade<br /></span></strong>In  <em>Brewing   Justice</em>, Daniel Jaffee writes that a central goal of  the Fair Trade  movement is to "create more direct, socially just, and  environmentally  responsible trade relations." Fair-trade organizations  may describe their   standards somewhat differently, but mostly the  following criteria apply:</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in 5pt 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span>Â·<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;"> </span></span></span>Guaranteed minimum  (floor) prices to producers; fair wages   to laborers; social  development premium</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in 5pt 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span>Â·<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;"> </span></span></span>Advance credit or  payment to producers</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in 5pt 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span>Â·<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;"> </span></span></span>Democratically run  producer cooperatives or workplaces</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in 5pt 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span>Â·<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;"> </span></span></span>Long-term  contracts and trading relationships</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in 5pt 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span>Â·<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;"> </span></span></span>Environmentally  sustainable production practices</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in 5pt 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span>Â·<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;"> </span></span></span>Public  accountability and financial transparency</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in 5pt  0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span>Â·<span style="font-family: 'Times  New Roman'; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;"> </span></span></span>Financial and  technical assistance to producers</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in 5pt 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span>Â·<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;"> </span></span></span>Safe,  nonexploitative working conditions.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;"><em>How   does Velasquez  Family Coffee implement our version of fair-trade?</em></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">First    we pay our family members a guaranteed price per pound of unroasted  coffee that   is far above the minimum price set for fairly traded  coffee. Although it has   varied by year and the quantity of coffee we  purchase, we have consistently paid   between $2.00 - $3.00 per pound. (<a href="http://www.transfairusa.org/content/resources/faq-advanced.php">Minimum    fair trade price</a> for coffee right now is $1.21, $1.41 for  certified  organic). We also time our payments to the coffee farmers  according to their   needs, part in advance of a shipment to help with  harvest and to get the coffee   ready to ship, and then the rest in  payments throughout the year as they need   it. (The have told us they  prefer not getting it all at once so we act as sort   of a savings  account for them and the money stays in dollars as long as possible    which retains its value a bit better than the Hondura Lempira  typically).</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt  0in;">Because   we are a family, we haven't created a  formal democratic cooperative. But we do   put our purchase agreements  in writing -- and of course our relationship is  naturally long-term.  We'll write more in future emails about the many  sustainability  practices that our family members follow, but if you are curious   now  you can read a bit about that in the <a href="../about">About our  Coffee</a> part of our website. We'll also touch more  on   accountability, transparency and worker conditions in the coming months.  (We   know you have better things to do than spend hours reading our  emails!)</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">Stay   Cool! (You can drink your coffee on ice too if  you wish! or visit this link for   <a href="http://www.eureka-java-gold.com/recipes.htm">iced coffee  recipes</a> if  you want something fancier.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #800000;">June 2007 Coffee News</span></strong></span></p><p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Lots of Family Togetherness<br /></span></strong>We've  got a number of family gatherings coming up, beginning   with a late  night trip to the airport <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tonight</span> to pick up Guillermo's  parents  Maximo and Natalia back again from Honduras. (We made sure they'd visit    again by buying a round trip ticket for them when they left in  February). This   time they're staying for the summer to help with kids.  With Maximo at 81 and   Natalia only a few years younger, we are  grateful for every minute we get to   spend with them!</p> <p>The next  week, shortly after we finish our June coffee deliveries, Cathy's    parents and her brother's family from Nashville will be coming to town  to see   the latest addition to our family, a beautiful baby boy born  just this week to   Cathy's other brother and his wife who live west of  Minneapolis. It will be a   joy to celebrate together!</p> <p>Over the  summer, we are looking forward to many family conversations. The    Velasquez Family (and the Eberharts too) are excellent  conversationalists and   story tellers. Often, the harder the original  experience the better, and  funnier the story you can tell about it for  years later. Recalling  an  experience in the rain, in the dark,  carrying children and suitcases for hours   up the mountain path to the  farm has everyone rolling in laughter. As do  experiences of car  trouble, childhood pranks and quirky neighbors. The art of   story  telling has the power to transform the past!</p> <p>We have fond  memories of sitting around a gas lamp in the farm house (where   there  is no electricty) or around a bon fire outside under the brilliant    stars laughing to jokes and family stories. Guillermo has a big family  too   -- he's the youngest of eight -- so when even a few of them get  together things   can get lively! It should be a fun summer.</p> <p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">More Coffee on the Way<br /></span></strong>We have    also heard the word from Guillermo's brothers Sabel and Abilio and    brother-in-law Alonzo that their 2007 coffee will be on its way to us  shortly.   They have packaged it up in 150 pound bags, handed it off one  of Guillermo's   cousins who will get it to the port city of Puerto  Cortez in Honduras where it   will be loaded in a ship headed for Miami.  Once it arrives there, we'll arrange   for a truck to pick it up and  deliver it to our roaster in Le Center, Minnesota.</p><p>Hope your  summer is shaping up to be a good one!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #800000;">May 2007 Coffee News</span></strong></span></p><p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Living Green is Hot!<br /></span></strong>We're  recovering from a very exciting (but exhausting) weekend at the    Living Green Expo. We've   participated in the <a href="http://www.livinggreenexpo.org/">Living Green  Expo</a> since  it started 5 years ago. We were in a cold windy tent that   first year  (yes it did snow in May that year!) Some of our most loyal  customers  have found us through this excellent event that showcases everything    "green." But we've never seen so many people as we did this weekend. On  Saturday   and Sunday, we both talked non-stop from 10:00 am - 5:00 pm  with what was surely   at least a thousand people who stopped by our  booth to learn about   Velasquez Family Coffee and see pictures of the  farm and our family.</p> <p>Organizers of the event said that on  Saturday alone 11,000 people attended  --  double the attendance on both  days last year. And Sunday was just as busy if  not  more so. We know  that we sold twice as much as before too. What an exciting  thing to see  so much interest in the environment, local foods, renewable energy,    and sustainability.</p> <p>It is exciting to be one small part of this  movement that is transforming  not  just the Twin Cities, but the  planet, as Paul Hawken writes in the latest issue   of Orion Magazine,  in his article "To Remake the World."</p> <p><em>"I have come to these  conclusions: this is the largest social movement  in  all of history, no  one knows its scope, and how it functions is more mysterious   than  what meets the eye. What does meet the eye is compelling: tens of  millions   of ordinary and not-so-ordinary people willing to confront  despair, power, and   incalculable odds in order to restore some  semblance of grace, justice, and  beauty to this world."</em></p> <p>If  you are in need of some hope, this is a must read article.

Together we are taking small  steps to create the economy that we   want to see, one based on fairness  and sustainability and mutual benefit.

It certainly isn't beach weather here in  Minesota.   But we are hopeful that Spring will eventually arrive (even  though we are  suppose to wake up to snow tomorrow!) In  addition to  going to the beach, Comayagua, the big city closest to the coffee    farms, is known for its colorful Easter Carpets made out of sawdust and  flower   petals. I've posted one photo below and found  another picture  and one American journalist's description of the event at: <a href="http://www.travel-to-honduras.com/travel/honduras-comayagua.php">http://www.travel-to-honduras.com/travel/honduras-comayagua.php</a></p><p><img title="Semana Santa" src="../files/vfamily/u4/bm_comayagua-semana-santa_smaller.jpg" alt="Semana Santa" width="300" height="199" />&nbsp;</p> <p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">VFC Website has moved<br /></span></strong>If  you've  stopped by our Website in the last week or so, you've probably  noticed  that it looks different. Similar in design and content, but somehow    different. With the help of folks at <a href="http://www.sundaysenergy.com/">Sunday's Energy</a>, we are   excited to have moved our website to an "open-source on-line contact    management system" called Drupel. That is, in English -- free   on-line  software that will let us more easily manage our website. We will also    be able to easily add features like e-commerce in the near future so  that people   can purchase on-line with a credit card and other fun  bells and whistles like  a  photo gallery. Perhaps we'll even do a  "blog" the next time we travel to  Honduras! But it can still be found  at <a href="//">http://www.vfamilycoffee.com</a>.</p> <p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Fair Trade and Green Events coming  up<br /></span></strong>While  Guillermo is busy delivering coffee this weekend,   Cathy will be busy  at a great Fair Trade event called The World Jubilee. She'll   be  selling unique handbags made out of recovered chip bags by women in the  Rio   Negro community near the coffee farm. If you were at our October  Open House   you had a chance to see them. But if you didn't here is a  photo. It's amazing how creative these women can be with empty potato  chip bags!</p><p><img title="Carteras" src="../files/vfamily/u4/Carteras001.jpg" alt="Carteras" width="500" height="375" />&nbsp;</p> <p>The World Jubilee  event is Saturday, April 14th from 9 AM - 4 PM at the  Gloria Dei  Church, 700 Snelling Ave. S in Saint Paul. We encourage you to stop    by. There are many wonderful items for sale from all over the world at  this  bi-annual event that provides alternative markets for economically  disadvantaged   groups from around the world.</p> <p>Also on Saturday,  there is a great <a href="http://www.globalwarmingdayofaction.org/">Global Warming  event</a> at the   State Capitol in St. Paul from 12-4. We wish we could  attend if we weren't  already double booked.</p> <p>We're also getting  ready to set up our display again at the <a href="http://www.livinggreenexpo.org/index.cfm">Living Green Expo </a>May  5-6.   We've had a couple of our customers offer to help us staff our  booth and we'd   happily welcome others if you are available.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #800000;">March 2007 Coffee News</span></strong></span></p><p>The word from Guillermo's parents is that they were greeted warmly on  their   return to Honduras. Their neighbors in the mountains by the  coffee farm have   showered them with gifts of chicks and hens and  bananas and daily visits to hear   about their long trip to Minnesota.</p><p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">French Visitors to the  Farm<br /></span></strong>We  just received an email from a young French man   who visited Rio Negro  this past weekend where Guillermo's parents and his  brothers have their  farms. While those of us here in Minnesota were digging   out from over  a foot of fluffy white snow (and enjoying a fun snow day on Friday    for sure), he and his two friends from France were hiking in the  tropical   forest. He wrote, <em>"Thank you to the Velasquez Family. I  am enchanted by Rio   Regro. The people are very friendly, the place is  marvelous, peaceful. The water   is fresh and good. I will definitely  remember it when I return to France."</em></p> <p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">A Visit to Our Coffee  Roaster<br /></span></strong>Last  month, we had so much to write about that we   didn't tell you about our  visit to European Roasterie in LeCenter with  Guillermo's family. We  thought Guillermo's sister Alma and her coffee-farmer   husband Alonzo  and Guillermo's parents would enjoy seeing the impressive   facility  where our green (unroasted) coffee is stored and roasted. So we   made  the 45 minute trip south to LeCenter.</p> <p>As usual we were greeted  very warmly by the nearly 60 employees who work  there. We were given an  extensive tour of the facility. Our family was  proud to see their bags  of coffee stored among the many thousands of   bags of coffee from all  over the world that European Roasterie buys, roasts   and sells. We saw  the large roasters where our coffee is carefully roasted each   month by  expertly trained roasters. And we saw where workers carefully  flavor,  ground, pack and label our coffee exactly according to our   specifications.</p> <p>Alonzo was honored to be asked to talk to a large  group of the staff to  explain how he grows, harvests and processes the  coffee. While the workers at   European Roasterie know a lot about  selecting and roasting coffee, they wanted   to take advantage of the  opportunity to learn from a real coffee farmer about   what happens on  the farm before the coffee reaches them. Here are a few photos from our  visit.</p><p><img title="Guillermo at ERI" src="../files/vfamily/u4/P1010005_resized.jpg" alt="Guillermo at  ERI" width="230" height="172" /></p><p><strong><span style="color: #800000;"><img title="visit to ERI" src="../files/vfamily/u4/P1010004_resized.jpg" alt="visit to ERI" width="307" height="230" /></span></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #800000;">February 2007 Coffee News</span></strong></span></p><p>After  spending 11 months with us, Guillermo's parents returned to Honduras   on  February 1. Just in time it seems. As the temperatures plunged below  -15 here  in  Minnesota, they were back in Comayagua soaking up the  heat. Guillermo's sister   Alma and her husband (and coffee farmer)  Alonzo came in mid January for a fun   two week visit, so they took the  opportunity to return to Honduras with them.</p> <p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Velasquez Family Coffee raises funds for Honduran    orphanage<br /></span></strong>The day before our family left for  Honduras, one  of  our coffee customers, Jane Flannigan left for her  second Honduran trip. She was   gracious enough to find time to write a  note about her experience before she   left:</p> <p>"My name is Jane  Flannigan and I'm packing for my second trip to Honduras.   Last August  my church, Most Holy Trinity in St. Louis Park, sponsored a mission    trip to a Nuestros PequeÃ±os Hermanos orphanage near Teguicigalpa. Rancho  Santa   Fe is home to 600 children and it was obvious that these  children were well  taken care of. Our group of 20 felt like part of the  family and we had a  fabulous time playing with the kids. We had  planned to build chicken coops but   that job was bumped so we could  help unpack and organize a container car of  medical supplies for a new  surgery center that will be opening soon. I also  worked in the kitchen  one day and helped make 800 tamales. The ranch has many   beautiful  flowers and the mountains could be seen off in the  distance.<br /><br />One  of our side trips was to our sister church, San Max Kolbe.   Four  Friars serve the needs of a parish community of 250,000. Many of these   people are very, very poor. The friars served us a wonderful lunch of  fish and   chicken and gave us a tour of the San Max property which sits  high on a hill   overlooking Teguicigalpa. We saw many citrus trees and  lush gardens full of  beautiful blossoms. Our church has been sending  funds to San Max for ten years.   It was very exciting to see their new  church that we helped build through our   funding.<br /><br />After  returning home in August I was fortunate enough to be  introduced to  Velasquez Family coffee. Our church now sells the coffee to  promote  Fair Trade and as a fundraiser for the next mission trip to Honduras.    The first time I picked up a coffee order I had the pleasure of meeting  Maximo   and Natalia who were visiting from Honduras. I have become  quite fond of  Maximo's French Roast and I'm even bringing a bag with me  when I go to Honduras   so we can enjoy every morning.<br /><br />In a few  days I am returning to Rancho   Santa Fe with two friends. We are  looking forward to seeing all the kids,  visiting San Max Kolbe and  having another adventure in Honduras."     --- Jane Flannigan</p> <p>We're  quite pleased that our coffee can be used to raise funds for this great    Honduran project!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style="color: #800000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">January 2007 Coffee News</span><br /></span></strong></p><p>The news from the coffee farm is wet -- too wet. The  Velasquez Family farm is located in a rain forest after all. But 20 days  of rain in a row without a break can be hard, especially if you have a  beautiful coffee crop waiting to be harvested. And unfortunately, the  heavy rains knocked down some of the coffee beans before they could be  picked.</p> <p>But don't worry, we still have plenty of coffee for you.  And Guillermo's brother Sabel and his brother-in-law Alonzo have coffee  fields in a few different areas that didn't receive quite as much rain.  But it was disappointing to lose some of their harvest, none-the-less.</p> <p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Coffee customers from Iowa to  Iraq<br /> </span></strong>This past weekend, we attended a wedding in  Ames, Iowa and had the pleasure of meeting some of our coffee customers  for the first time face to face -- Cathy's brother's wife's sister's new  husband's parents. (Did you get that?) A great example of how many of  our customers come to us through word of mouth! Thanks for helping us  spread the word about our coffee.</p> <p>Also in Iowa, we've been  meaning to tell you about <a href="http://www.simoneplainandsimple.com/index.html">Simone Plain  and Simple</a> in Wellman, Iowa. Simone Delaty, another Iowa coffee  customer of ours, was recently featured in the New Pioneer Food Coop's  newsletter. The article - and her website <a href="http://www.simoneplainandsimple.com/">www.simoneplainandsimple.com</a> - tell about her artisan breads and the wonderful dinner parties she  hosts at her farm in southeast Iowa, as well as her passion for using  fresh, local produce and the Local Harvest CSA that she helped start. We  have not yet had the pleasure of enjoying a meal with Simone, but hope  to someday. We've heard great things about her place. If you are ever in  the area, do check her out!</p> <p><span style="color: #800000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Velasquez Family Coffee has also been regularly  traveling first to Camp Shelby and now all the way to Iraq thanks to  regular purchases by one of our Adams Spanish Immersion fundraiser  customers who sends coffee to her husband Captain Fernando Franco  deployed with the Minnesota Army National Guard. Mary says the soldiers  "LOVE our coffee!!" (her emphasis not ours) and suggested that if folks  were interested in purchasing coffee for the troops, she and her husband  could get it distributed (and we would chip in for the mailing costs).  Just let us know if we could add the cost of an additional bag or 2 to  your order and we'll make sure it gets to the Minnesota Army National  Guard folks stationed in Iraq.</span></span></p><p>Here is a photo we  received from the MN National Guard after the coffee arrived.</p><p><img title="VFC Coffee in Iraq" src="../files/vfamily/u4/Coffee_in_Iraq.jpg" alt="VFC Coffee in Iraq" width="324" height="243" /></p>  </div>
