  <div class="content">
    <p>-"Salud, Dinero y Amor"<br />-Local Dollars, Local Sense<br />-VFC Financial Update<br />-Managing for Success<br />-More News on Facebook</p><p>Guillermo has a cousin who, when someone sneezes, is quick to say <em>"Salud,     Dinero y Amor."</em> That is to say, she expands the&nbsp;usual   Spanish&nbsp;blessing of "Salud" to offer you wishes of Health, Money and Love.     Since we talked about the blessings of love <a href="http://www.vfamilycoffee.com/node/809">last month</a>,&nbsp;it seemed   appropriate to talk about Money this month, especially since we are long overdue     in sharing our annual financial report.&nbsp;(Perhaps we'll need to write about     health and coffee sometime soon too!)&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Local   Economies<br /></span></strong>In&nbsp;contrast to all the typical talk about the     economy being thrown around by politicians and pundits these days, we've been     reading an insightful book from the Post Carbon Institute's <a href="http://www.chelseagreen.com/content/presenting-the-community-resilience-guides-a-partnership-with-the-post-carbon-institute/" target="_blank">Community     Resilience</a> series called&nbsp;<em><a href="http://www.chelseagreen.com/bookstore/item/local_dollars_local_sense" target="_blank">Local     Dollars, Local Sense</a></em> that gives examples&nbsp;of people investing in     their&nbsp;local economies. We've&nbsp;found inspiration in   alternatives&nbsp;being created beyond Wall Street for investors and   entrepreneurs alike.&nbsp;A short teaser of the book can be found in author   Michael Shuman's article <a href="http://www.chelseagreen.com/content/10-reasons-for-financial-optimism-if-you-invest-locally/" target="_blank">"10     Reasons for Financial Optimism (If You Invest Locally)"</a>.</p> <p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">VFC Financial Update</span></strong><br />The book     has also&nbsp;gotten us thinking about our own finances and we realized we   hadn't yet shared our traditional Velasquez Family Coffee annual&nbsp;financial     update. (Those of you who have been with us for a while know that we've been     giving an annual financial report for quite some time now. <a href="http://www.vfamilycoffee.com/node/786">2010</a>, <a href="http://www.vfamilycoffee.com/node/188">2009</a>, <a href="http://www.vfamilycoffee.com/node/169">2008</a>, etc.)</p> <p>The truth is, after enjoying an average of 25% growth&nbsp;for the past 5     years, 2011 fell flat with only 1% growth in our gross sales. This concerned   us,   of course, and so we dug deeper into our numbers and found, to our relief, that     sales from&nbsp;the core parts of our business -- Monthly Deliveries and Monthly     Mail orders&nbsp;-- had continued to grow. Where we saw declines&nbsp;was in   our   wholesale and fundraiser customers in 2011. We've been monitoring things closely     this year, and are pleased that for Jan-Sept of 2012, we are seeing an   overall&nbsp;20% increase in gross sales from the same time period last year,   so   hopefully we are back on track.</p> <p>Nonetheless, we also have had to manage a significant increase in the cost   of   coffee. Due to world coffee prices spiking in 2010, we increased the price we     pay&nbsp;our family members to $3.20&nbsp;per&nbsp;pound in 2011 and have mostly     maintained that at $3.00 a pound this year. In addition, we share with other     Fair Trade coffee companies the ongoing cash flow dilemma of buying significant     amounts of coffee upfront.&nbsp;Equal Exchange is quoted describing that reality     in <em>Local Dollars Local Sense</em>,</p> <p><em>"Fair-trade coffee actually requires a lot of up-front capital. Because     we're fair trade, we take possession of the coffee as soon as it's harvested.   We   also provide for pre-harvest financing. So we're paying and financing the stuff     we're selling long before we can ever sell it. We believe that manufacturers   and   sellers of coffee products should be carrying those costs not the farmers. But     that means we have millions of dollars of our working capital tied up in   inventory."</em>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Managing for Success<br /></strong></span><span style="color: #000000;">Thankfully we don't have Millions of dollars tied up in inventory,     but we are thinking of alternative ways to pay for our large coffee purchases     each year beyond&nbsp;our&nbsp;credit union's line of credit and a few low   interest credit cards. One idea we've gleaned from Shuman's&nbsp;book, is to     invite our customers to prepay for coffee, perhaps 6 to 12 months in advance,     and in exchange pass on a slight discount for the interest we'll save. Another     is to tighten up our policies around late payments. We might also add a line   to   our invoices for a strictly voluntary "tip." All of these ideas will hopefully     allow us to avoid another price increase in the short term. We're working   through the details of&nbsp;these options and hope to roll them out in the next     few months.</span></p> <p>To increase sales, we're also trying out a few new marketing opportunities     that have come our way. Look for our ads in the City Pages Wine and Dine Guide     later this month and in <a href="http://www.ediblecommunities.com/twincities/our-advertisers/our-advertisers/our-advertisers.htm" target="_blank">Edible     Twin Cities</a>. We'll be at our church's annual <a href="http://www.prospectparkchurch.org/artfair2012.html" target="_blank">Bazaar and Art   Fair</a> on November 3rd. We'll be listed in the <a href="http://www.buylocaltwincities.com/" target="_blank">Metro Independent Business   Association</a> Local Gift Guide which will be highlighted at its November 19th     <a href="http://www.buylocaltwincities.com/node/2372" target="_blank">buy local shopping   event</a>. And for the first time, we'll be attending the <a href="http://www.doitgreen.org/gifts-fair" target="_blank">Green Gifts Fair</a> on November 17th     when the 2013 <a href="http://www.doitgreen.org/node/2359" target="_blank">Do it Green   directory</a> will also be launched.</p> <p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">More News from Honduras and Fair   Trade<br /></span></strong>October is&nbsp;<a href="http://www.daysoftheyear.com/days/fair-trade-month/" target="_blank">Fair Trade Month</a> and we considered basing this newsletter on that fine topic. However, since   space doesn't allow us to write about everything, we've decided instead&nbsp;to     use our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/VelasquezFamilyCoffee" target="_blank">Facebook   Page</a> to link to a few intesting articles about the current controvesies in     the Fair Trade Coffee world as well two news articles from Honduras, one about     coffee exports and the&nbsp;second --&nbsp;just in time for Halloween -- about     politicians giving away coffins! (And you thought our politicians had problems!)     While you're there - be sure to "Like" us if you haven't already.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Holiday Flavor Vote</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #800000;">&nbsp;<br /></span></strong>With colder temperatures and brisk   winds, it definitely feels time to start thinking about our annual holiday   flavor vote. Our plan for 2012 is to let you choose from among the many great     flavors we've offered in the past. Look for an email&nbsp;with a link to the     flavor vote survey in mid-October and respond quickly. This year we will be   giving a free bag of&nbsp;holiday&nbsp;coffee to the first 50   respondents!</p>  </div>
