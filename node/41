    <p>-35-W Bridge collapse<br />-Global Connections<br />-Fair Trade Part 2: accountability, transparency and worker  conditions<br />-Coop America Business Network</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;"><span style="color: maroon;"><strong>35-W Bridge Collapse</strong></span><br />Everywhere   you turn these days, people are thinking and talking about the 35W bridge  collapse in Minneapolis. It has certainly been in our thoughts as well,  although, thankfully, none of our family or friends were directly involved. But   our hearts go out to the families and friends of the victims and in particular   to one of our customers whose friend is among those confirmed as dead.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">From   a practical perspective, we are grateful that the 35W bridge was not part of  our  regular coffee delivery route. However, there will be a slight change this month   as we experiment with doing some of our August home deliveries on Friday, August   10th and the rest on Saturday the 11th. We now have over 60 deliveries to  do (yay!) and we're hoping that spreading them out over two days will   make things a bit calmer. We're also hoping to get our more than 20 mailed  orders out a bit earlier too, dropping them off with FedEx or the Post Office  by  Saturday the 11th.</p><p><span style="color: maroon;"><strong>Global Connections</strong><br /></span>The   Minneapolis bridge tragedy has also proved to be a lesson of how connected   we are and how quickly news spreads. Within a few hours of the collapse, we  received phone calls from South Dakota, Virginia, Florida, Tennesee and even   Honduras making sure we were all OK. It is that global connectedness (helped   along by tools such as email, cell phones, and the Web) that makes our little   fair-trade effort possible. Globalization is not only a force of multi-national   corporations helping the rich get richer. It is also an opportunity for   ordinary people to bring about change. Daniel Jaffee, in <em>Brewing  Justice</em>, quotes the president of Brazil, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva as  saying we need to make international trade "a tool not only for creating   wealth, but also for its distribution."</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;"><span style="color: maroon;"><strong>More on Fair Trade</strong></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">Last   month, we promised to write more about how Velasquez Family Coffee addresses  the  fair trade concepts of accountability, transparency and worker  conditions. A year ago, we were pleased to be accepted into the Coop  America Business Network and included in the <a href="http://www.coopamerica.org/pubs/greenpages/detail.cfm?key=19511">National   Green Pages</a>. (<a href="http://www.coopamerica.org/">Coop America</a> is one   of our favorite groups and a great resource on green and <a href="http://www.coopamerica.org/programs/fairtrade/whattoknow/12waystoshopfairtrade.cfm">fair   trade</a> living.)</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">As   part of the screening process, Coop America asked us several tough questions.   Here are our honest answers (we believe honesty is a key part of  accountability and transparency!)</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;"><strong>Q.   Wages are only a part of fair trade.  Beyond wages, does Velasquez Family   Coffee adhere to the other components of fair trade as enumerated by the  Fairtrade Labelling Organisation (FLO)?</strong></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">A.   <em>Our business also reflects the following additional fair trade  values:</em></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;"><em>Long   Term and Stable Relationships -- By purchasing from family members, we naturally   have a permanent relationship and commitment -- both with the growers and the   community where they farm -- that goes beyond business. But we also make sure  to  give written documentation to family members each year of the coffee we will  be  purchasing and the price we will pay.</em></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;"><em>Pricing   and Premium -- We pay our family members between $2.00 and $3.00 per pound of   green coffee -- far above the Fair trade minimum price even for organic coffee.   In 2006, we paid $2.50.</em></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;"><strong>Q.   You mention that family members are paid well.  Is there a code of conduct   or specific labor criteria for any farm workers hired by your family  members?  What is the policy for sharing profits with these  workers?</strong></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">A.   <em>Family members are committed to good conditions for their workers, but we,   unfortunately, do not have a "code of conduct" or any specific "labor criteria"   for farm workers. Nor do we have a policy for sharing profits. We would welcome   examples of policies that other groups are using. </em></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;"><em>In   practice, the family members we purchase coffee from, have enjoyed long term   relationships with many of their coffee workers. They pay them a bit above the   going rate in their community, provide them with food and housing and  transportation. For small coffee farmers like our family members, finding enough   people to pick coffee during the harvest season has become a challenge  especially in the last few years. More and more people are finding work in  maquiladores factories or leaving for the U.S. As a result, small coffee farmers   have had to work really hard to offer attractive working conditions for their   employees, simply to have enough labor. </em></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;"><em>Yet,   we admit, this is an area of our business that could use improvement. As we are   able to purchase more of our family's coffee (we currently only purchase about   half), we hope that they will be able to have the financial stability themselves   to be able to support their workers with higher wages. As mentioned above, we   would also recommend examples of other standards for farm workers that our  family members could implement.<br /></em></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">Another   part of accountability and transparency has to do with being open about the flow   of money. Look for a break down on the costs that go into a typical bag of  coffee next month.</p>  </div>
