    <p>-Exporting and Importing<br />-New Honduran President<br />-Worth Repeating</p>
<p><strong><font color="#800000">Exporting and Importing<br /></font></strong>We have spent the past few months learning the many steps involved in  international commerce. For nine years, we have worked with one of Guillermo's  cousins to import our coffee to Minnesota and have been blissfully unaware of  exporting and customs requirements. But this year, we are importing enough  coffee to fill our own container and so we are diving into this new arena for  the first time.</p>
<p>We are  excited to have reached this milestone of becoming our own importer. In 2001, the  first year we imported coffee (other than in our suitcases), we received 1,950  pounds of coffee. This year, we are planning to import about 15,000 pounds of  our family's coffee. This still would not be enough to fill a 20 foot cargo  container, apparently, but we have the good fortune of being able to work with  <a href="http://www.farmertofarmer.org/">Farmer to Farmer</a>, a fair trade  coffee group in Wisconsin, that has ordered a similar amount of coffee from the  same region. Andy Gaertner, one of their leaders, visited the Velasquez family  coffee farm when he was a Peace Corp volunteer in Honduras many years ago and  since then has worked with a fledgling cooperative of coffee farmers from the  Rio Negro area to bring their coffee to Wisconsin. (Andy has a great article on  "thrift, ingenuity and poverty" in Honduras in the winter issue of the Farmer to  Farmer <a href="http://www.farmertofarmer.org/files/march10web.pdf">newsletter</a> page  3).</p>
<p>Through a connection with another great group, we are now working with CH  Robinson to figure out all of the logistical details involved in moving that  much coffee from a small village in Honduras, through Honduran and U.S. customs  and up to Minnesota. About a year ago, Terry Munoz with <a href="http://www.sbsyouth.org/">Side by Side Ministries</a> contacted us about  using Velasquez Family coffee for a fundraiser project called "Sam and Evan's  coffee" to support their wonderful work with youth here and in Central America.  They connected us with CH Robinson through one of their board members. And now  we are filling out "Importer Security Filing" forms, identifying our "Harmonized  Tariff number", and waiting to get our "Bill of Lading" number before the ship  carrying our container full of coffee leaves Puerto Cortez for its journey to  the U.S. (Can you tell we are learning a lot!) Hopefully if all goes as  planned, our coffee will arrive safe and sound in Minnesota before the end of  the month. (But don't worry, we have plenty of coffee already here to last for  many months in case the ship is delayed, by say, a massive oil spill.)</p>
<p><strong><font color="#800000">New Honduran President<br /></font></strong>Our  email newsletter the past few months has been so long that we haven't had a  chance to give an update on the political situation in Honduras until now. If  you'll remember, President Zelaya was kicked out in a coup last June. Already  scheduled elections took place in November and a new President "Pepe" Lobo, was  inaugerated rather peacefully in January. Several South American countries still  refuse to recognize the new government, but the US says it is time for the  Organization of American States to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6457AU20100506">readmit  Honduras</a>. President Lobo has established a "<a href="http://www1.voanews.com/policy/editorials/Human-Rights-In-Honduras-92971069.html?refresh=1">Truth  Commission</a>" to document human rights abuses during the coup, but <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bertha-oliva/a-real-truth-commission-f_b_563215.html">Human  Rights activists</a> complain that it isn't enough and point to the recent  killing of several journalists and civic activists. While the President tries to  establish a new normal, it is interesting to read Professor Dana Frank's  analysis that a <a href="https://nacla.org/node/6541">new grassroots culture of  resistance</a> has emerged in Honduras that may have a lasting impact on the  future of this formerly quiet country.</p>
<p><strong><font color="#800000">Worth Repeating<br /></font></strong>Finally a few  things that seem worthy of saying again.</p>
<p>-<em>Really Recycled Invoices</em> - Don't be surprised if there is something  on the back of your coffee invoice. We plan to keep using scrap paper for our  invoices until we run out (which will probably never happen with all the paper  our kids bring home and that comes in the mail).</p>
<p>-<em>Alonzo's Heirloom Bourbon Coffee</em> - We have about 400 lbs of  this special heirloom coffee left, so it should last for a few months, possibly  until the end of the year, depending on how quickly it sells.</p>
<p>-<em>Tear Off Posters</em> - We can print more posters if you are interested  in promoting our coffee in your apartment, workplace or house of worship. Just  let us know.</p>
<p>It was great to see many of our customers at the Living Green Expo last  weekend and to meet many new people!</p>  </div>
